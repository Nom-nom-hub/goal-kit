# Adapt Command (`/goalkit.adapt`)

## Overview

The Adapt command enables strategy adjustments based on results, learning, and changing requirements. It formalizes the process of changing course when evidence suggests a different approach would better achieve goals.

## Purpose

The `/goalkit.adapt` command is essential for:

- Adjusting strategies based on measurement results and learning
- Formalizing the process of changing course when needed
- Updating goals, milestones, or approaches based on new information
- Documenting the rationale for strategic changes
- Maintaining alignment with outcomes when approaches need modification
- Supporting continuous improvement and learning integration

## Usage

```
/goalkit.adapt [Description of adaptation needed and approach]
```

## Key Components

### Current Challenge
Clear description of what isn't working or what has changed that necessitates adaptation.

### Evidence
Data, measurements, or feedback that support the need for adaptation.

### Proposed Changes
Specific changes to be made to strategies, goals, or milestones.

### Expected Impact
How the adaptation is expected to improve goal achievement.

### Implementation Plan
Steps needed to implement the adaptation.

### Success Indicators
How to measure if the adaptation was successful.

## Best Practices

- Use data and evidence to drive adaptation decisions
- Communicate adaptations clearly to all stakeholders
- Document the rationale for changes to support learning
- Ensure adaptations still align with overall project vision
- Update related goals and milestones when making adaptations
- Monitor the results of adaptations to validate their effectiveness
- Be willing to make adaptations quickly when evidence supports it

## Example

```
/goalkit.adapt User data shows 60% mobile usage but current web-first strategy only serves 20% mobile users effectively. Pivot to mobile-responsive approach, update milestones to prioritize mobile experience, and adjust success metrics for mobile user engagement.

/goalkit.adapt Performance testing reveals that current database approach doesn't meet scalability requirements for expected user growth. Adapt by implementing a caching layer and database sharding approach while maintaining original goals for user experience and system performance.

/goalkit.adapt Security audit identifies vulnerabilities in the current authentication approach that could compromise user data. Adapt by implementing additional security measures, extending timeline for milestone 2, and adding security testing to all future milestones.
```

## Integration with Goal-Driven Development

The adapt command is fundamental to the Goal-Driven Development methodology's emphasis on adaptive execution and learning integration. It provides a structured approach to changing strategies when evidence shows a different approach would better achieve goals. This command ensures that teams can respond to new information, changing requirements, or unexpected challenges while maintaining focus on achieving the defined outcomes. It supports the principle of treating implementation as hypothesis testing, where strategies can be adjusted based on results while still maintaining commitment to achieving the overall goals.
