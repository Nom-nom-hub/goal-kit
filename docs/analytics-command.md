# Analytics Command (`/goalkit.analytics`)

## Overview

The Analytics command establishes systems for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data to measure progress toward goals. It ensures that goal achievement can be objectively evaluated through quantitative analysis and data-driven insights.

## Purpose

The `/goalkit.analytics` command is essential for:

- Setting up data collection systems to track goal progress
- Establishing analytics frameworks for measuring success metrics
- Creating reporting mechanisms to monitor project health
- Defining key performance indicators (KPIs) aligned with goals
- Implementing data visualization tools for stakeholder communication

## Usage

```
/goalkit.analytics [description of analytics requirements, metrics to track, and reporting needs]
```

## Key Components

### Data Collection Strategy
Plan for how data will be collected, stored, and processed to support goal measurement and validation.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Specific metrics that will indicate progress toward goals and overall project success.

### Analytics Tools and Platforms
Selection and configuration of tools for data analysis, visualization, and reporting.

### Reporting Framework
Schedule and format for regular reporting on goal progress and project metrics.

### Data Privacy and Security
Considerations for protecting sensitive data while maintaining effective analytics capabilities.

## Best Practices

- Align analytics with specific goals and success metrics defined in `/goalkit.goal`
- Implement analytics early in the development process to capture baseline data
- Ensure data accuracy and reliability through validation processes
- Create dashboards that provide clear visibility into goal progress
- Establish automated alerts for when metrics fall outside acceptable ranges
- Regularly review and refine analytics as goals evolve

## Example

```
/goalkit.analytics Set up analytics for a user engagement goal: track daily active users, session duration, feature adoption rates, and user satisfaction scores. Implement Google Analytics for web metrics and custom event tracking for specific user actions. Create weekly dashboards showing trend lines for all key metrics with alerts for significant changes. Ensure all tracking complies with privacy regulations and user consent requirements.
```

## Integration with Goal-Driven Development

Analytics provide the quantitative foundation for Goal-Driven Development by enabling objective measurement of progress toward defined goals. This command supports the methodology's emphasis on measurable progress and evidence-based decision making. Analytics systems capture the data needed to validate whether strategies are effective and whether goals are being achieved according to defined success criteria.
