# Explore Command (`/goalkit.explore`)

## Overview

The Explore command allows for deeper investigation of alternative approaches and what-if scenarios. It provides a structured way to dive deeper into specific aspects of a project when more understanding is needed.

## Purpose

The `/goalkit.explore` command is essential for:

- Investigating specific aspects of a project in more depth
- Exploring alternative approaches that weren't covered in the initial strategy phase
- Researching new technologies or methodologies relevant to the project
- Considering what-if scenarios and their potential impacts
- Gathering more information when uncertainty exists about the best approach
- Supporting continuous learning and discovery during execution

## Usage

```
/goalkit.explore [Detailed exploration request]
```

## Key Components

### Exploration Focus
A clear definition of what specifically needs to be explored, providing direction and boundaries for the investigation.

### Background Context
Relevant context about why this exploration is needed and how it relates to the current goals and strategies.

### Expected Outcomes
Clear indication of what knowledge, options, or decisions should result from the exploration.

### Relationship to Goals
How the exploration connects to specific project goals and whether it might impact current strategies or milestones.

## Best Practices

- Use exploration when uncertainty exists about the best path forward
- Connect explorations directly to specific goals or milestones
- Set clear boundaries for the exploration to avoid scope creep
- Document findings and decisions resulting from exploration
- Consider how exploration results might impact current strategies
- Balance exploration time with execution to maintain progress

## Example

```
/goalkit.explore Dive deeper into authentication options: research passwordless authentication, investigate biometric options, and compare different identity provider integrations for our use case.

/goalkit.explore Investigate performance implications of different database options for our high-volume transaction system. Compare PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis for our specific use case with emphasis on read/write speeds and scaling capabilities.

/goalkit.explore Explore alternative UI frameworks that could reduce bundle size and improve load times. Compare React, Vue, and Svelte for our specific project requirements focusing on performance, team familiarity, and ecosystem maturity.
```

## Integration with Goal-Driven Development

The explore command supports the Goal-Driven Development principle of flexible strategy exploration by providing a mechanism to investigate alternatives during execution. It allows teams to respond to new information or changing requirements by diving deeper into specific aspects of their approach. This command is particularly valuable when new challenges emerge that require deeper investigation or when opportunities arise that could improve goal achievement. It maintains the focus on outcomes while allowing for adaptive strategy refinement based on new learning.
