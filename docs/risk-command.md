# Risk Command (`/goalkit.risk`)

## Overview

The Risk command identifies, analyzes, and plans for potential risks that could impact goal achievement. It ensures proactive risk management within the goal-driven development process.

## Purpose

The `/goalkit.risk` command is essential for:

- Identifying potential risks to goal achievement
- Analyzing the likelihood and impact of different risks
- Creating mitigation strategies for high-priority risks
- Establishing risk monitoring and response procedures
- Supporting informed decision-making by considering risk factors

## Usage

```
/goalkit.risk [description of risk assessment needs and specific areas to evaluate]
```

## Key Components

### Risk Identification
Systematic identification of potential risks that could impact goal achievement.

### Risk Analysis
Assessment of likelihood and potential impact of identified risks.

### Mitigation Strategies
Specific approaches for reducing likelihood or impact of risks.

### Contingency Planning
Preparation of response plans if risks materialize.

### Risk Monitoring
Ongoing tracking and evaluation of risk factors.

## Best Practices

- Regularly reassess risks as the project evolves and new information becomes available
- Prioritize risks based on their potential impact on goal achievement
- Involve multiple perspectives in risk identification and analysis
- Balance risk mitigation with the flexibility needed for adaptation
- Document risks and mitigation strategies for stakeholder visibility
- Create risk-aware strategies that account for potential challenges

## Example

```
/goalkit.risk Assess risks to achieving our authentication system goals: technical risks (performance bottlenecks, security vulnerabilities), implementation risks (resource constraints, technology complexity), and outcome risks (not meeting 99.9% login success rate, user satisfaction falling below 4.5/5.0). Develop mitigation strategies for top risks including performance testing protocols, security audit procedures, and user feedback gathering during development. Establish risk monitoring to track mitigation effectiveness and identify new risks.
```

## Integration with Goal-Driven Development

The risk command supports the Goal-Driven Development methodology by ensuring that potential obstacles to goal achievement are proactively identified and addressed. Risk management is essential for successful goal achievement while maintaining the flexibility to adapt strategies. This command helps teams prepare for challenges while preserving the adaptive approach needed for learning and improvement that is central to the methodology.
