# Schedule Command (`/goalkit.schedule`)

## Overview

The Schedule command creates and manages timelines for goal achievement, milestone completion, and strategic implementation. It balances the need for planning with the flexibility required for adaptive execution in goal-driven development.

## Purpose

The `/goalkit.schedule` command is essential for:

- Creating realistic timelines for goal achievement and milestone completion
- Balancing planning needs with adaptive execution requirements
- Coordinating activities across different team members and stakeholders
- Establishing checkpoints for evaluating progress and adaptation
- Managing dependencies between different activities and goals

## Usage

```
/goalkit.schedule [description of scheduling requirements and timeline constraints]
```

## Key Components

### Timeline Framework
Flexible structure that accommodates goal achievement while allowing for adaptation.

### Milestone Scheduling
Timing for key checkpoints that align with goal measurement and evaluation.

### Adaptation Windows
Built-in opportunities to reassess strategies and adjust timelines based on learning.

### Resource Coordination
Scheduling of resources and team members to support goal achievement.

### Dependency Management
Consideration of dependencies between activities and their impact on scheduling.

## Best Practices

- Create flexible schedules that accommodate learning and adaptation
- Build in buffers for unexpected challenges and strategy pivots
- Align schedule checkpoints with goal measurement opportunities
- Regularly reassess and adjust schedules based on progress and learning
- Communicate schedule expectations clearly to all stakeholders
- Balance commitment to timelines with flexibility for improvement

## Example

```
/goalkit.schedule Create a flexible schedule for achieving our authentication system goals: target 3 months for reaching 99.9% login success rate and 4.5/5.0 user satisfaction. Include bi-weekly checkpoints to evaluate strategy effectiveness and make adjustments, monthly stakeholder reviews to assess progress, and built-in adaptation windows to pivot strategies if early results indicate different approaches are needed. Plan for potential delays in security audit processes and include alternative approaches if timeline targets are not met.
```

## Integration with Goal-Driven Development

The schedule command supports the Goal-Driven Development methodology by creating timelines that accommodate both planning needs and adaptive execution. Unlike rigid project schedules, this command emphasizes flexibility and built-in opportunities for reassessment and adjustment. The schedules created support the methodology's emphasis on measurable progress and learning while providing structure for coordination and accountability.
