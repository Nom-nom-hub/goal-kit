# Reflect Command (`/goalkit.reflect`)

## Overview

The Reflect command facilitates structured reflection on progress, experiences, and outcomes to improve future goal achievement. It creates opportunities for systematic evaluation and learning from development activities.

## Purpose

The `/goalkit.reflect` command is essential for:

- Creating structured opportunities for team reflection
- Evaluating progress toward goals and effectiveness of strategies
- Identifying improvement opportunities for future work
- Supporting continuous learning and methodology improvement
- Documenting insights and lessons learned from experiences

## Usage

```
/goalkit.reflect [description of what to reflect on and specific aspects to evaluate]
```

## Key Components

### Reflection Focus
Clear definition of what experiences, progress, or outcomes will be reflected upon.

### Evaluation Criteria
Standards and metrics against which experiences will be evaluated.

### Learning Extraction
Systematic process for identifying lessons and insights from experiences.

### Improvement Identification
Specific improvement opportunities identified through reflection.

### Action Planning
Concrete actions to implement improvements in future work.

## Best Practices

- Schedule regular reflection sessions aligned with milestone completion
- Ensure reflection focuses on outcomes and goal achievement
- Include diverse perspectives in reflection sessions
- Document reflection outcomes for future reference
- Connect reflection insights to specific goals and strategies
- Use reflection to inform strategy adaptation and improvement

## Example

```
/goalkit.reflect Conduct a structured reflection on the first milestone of our authentication system implementation: evaluate how well our chosen strategy met our goal of 99.9% login success rate, assess team collaboration effectiveness, analyze performance against our sub-3-second response time target, and identify process improvements for future milestones. Include perspectives from development, QA, and product teams, and document specific actions to improve strategy effectiveness for the next milestone.
```

## Integration with Goal-Driven Development

The reflection command supports the Goal-Driven Development methodology's emphasis on learning integration and adaptive execution. Regular reflection ensures that teams systematically evaluate their progress toward goals and effectiveness of their strategies. It provides the structured approach needed to extract learning from experiences and apply it to improve future goal achievement, supporting the methodology's hypothesis-testing approach to implementation.
