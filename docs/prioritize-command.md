# Prioritize Command (`/goalkit.prioritize`)

## Overview

The Prioritize command establishes clear priority order for goals, features, tasks, and strategies based on their impact on desired outcomes. It helps teams focus their efforts on the highest-value activities for achieving their goals.

## Purpose

The `/goalkit.prioritize` command is essential for:

- Ranking goals, features, and tasks based on outcome impact
- Determining which activities to focus on first for maximum effectiveness
- Balancing multiple goals and their competing requirements
- Making informed decisions about resource allocation
- Ensuring focus on activities that contribute most directly to goal achievement

## Usage

```
/goalkit.prioritize [description of items to prioritize and criteria for prioritization]
```

## Key Components

### Priority Criteria
Clear criteria that will be used to evaluate and rank different items, aligned with goal success metrics.

### Impact Assessment
Evaluation of how each item contributes to goal achievement and desired outcomes.

### Priority Framework
Structured approach for comparing and ranking different items against each other.

### Resource Allocation
Consideration of required resources in relation to expected impact on goals.

### Timeline Considerations
How timing affects prioritization of different activities.

## Best Practices

- Align priorities directly with goal success criteria
- Consider both immediate and long-term impact on goals
- Balance strategic priorities with urgent needs
- Regularly reassess priorities as new information becomes available
- Communicate prioritization rationale to stakeholders
- Document prioritization decisions and their justification

## Example

```
/goalkit.prioritize Rank the following features for our authentication system based on their impact on our goals of achieving 99.9% login success rate and 4.5+/5 user satisfaction: password complexity enforcement, multi-factor authentication, password recovery, biometric authentication, and single sign-on. Prioritize based on their expected impact on our success metrics, implementation complexity, and user experience improvements. Focus first on elements that directly impact our login success rate, then on features that improve user satisfaction.
```

## Integration with Goal-Driven Development

The prioritization command supports the Goal-Driven Development methodology by ensuring that efforts are focused on activities that most directly contribute to goal achievement. This command helps maintain the focus on outcomes by systematically evaluating which activities will have the greatest impact on success metrics. Prioritization helps teams navigate multiple strategies and competing demands while maintaining alignment with the defined goals and success criteria.
