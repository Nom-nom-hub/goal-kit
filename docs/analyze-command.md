# Analyze Command (`/goalkit.analyze`)

## Overview

The Analyze command performs in-depth examination of project elements, code, or systems to understand current state, identify issues, and uncover opportunities for improvement. It provides structured analysis to inform decision-making in the goal-driven development process.

## Purpose

The `/goalkit.analyze` command is essential for:

- Performing comprehensive analysis of existing code, architecture, or systems
- Identifying technical debt, performance bottlenecks, or security vulnerabilities
- Understanding how current implementations align with goals and success criteria
- Evaluating the effectiveness of current strategies and approaches
- Providing data-driven insights to inform adaptation decisions

## Usage

```
/goalkit.analyze [description of what to analyze and specific aspects to examine]
```

## Key Components

### Analysis Scope
Clear definition of what elements will be analyzed, including code, architecture, performance metrics, or other project components.

### Analysis Criteria
Specific criteria against which the analysis will be performed, such as performance, security, maintainability, or alignment with goals.

### Analysis Method
The approach and tools that will be used to perform the analysis, ensuring thorough and systematic examination.

### Expected Outcomes
Clear definition of what should result from the analysis, such as recommendations, issue identification, or improvement opportunities.

### Reporting Format
Structure for how analysis results will be presented and communicated to stakeholders.

## Best Practices

- Align analysis scope with specific goals and success metrics
- Use appropriate tools and methodologies for the type of analysis required
- Document findings clearly with specific, actionable recommendations
- Prioritize findings based on impact to goal achievement
- Share analysis results with relevant stakeholders in a timely manner
- Follow up on analysis recommendations to ensure implementation

## Example

```
/goalkit.analyze Perform a comprehensive analysis of the current authentication system focusing on security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, and scalability limitations. Evaluate against security best practices, response time requirements, and user experience goals. Include recommendations for improvements that align with our goal of achieving 99.9% login success rate and sub-3-second response time.
```

## Integration with Goal-Driven Development

The analysis command supports the Goal-Driven Development principle of measurement and learning by providing objective evaluation of current systems and implementations. Analysis results inform decisions about whether current strategies are effective and identify opportunities for improvement. This command enables evidence-based adaptation, allowing teams to adjust approaches based on systematic evaluation rather than assumptions.
