# Goal Kit Documentation

Welcome to the Goal Kit documentation. Goal Kit implements Goal-Driven Development, a methodology that focuses on outcomes and learning rather than detailed upfront specifications.

## Quick Start

1. **Set Vision**: Establish your project vision and principles
2. **Define Goals**: Create measurable goals with success criteria
3. **Explore Strategies**: Consider multiple approaches for each goal
4. **Plan Milestones**: Break goals into measurable progress steps
5. **Execute & Learn**: Implement with continuous adaptation

## Key Concepts

### Goal-Driven Development

Goal-Driven Development (GDD) focuses on outcomes over specifications. While traditional development creates detailed specifications that generate specific implementations, GDD starts with high-level goals and explores multiple strategies to achieve them.

### Key Principles

- **Outcome-driven**: Focus on what success looks like, not how to achieve it
- **Flexible strategy exploration**: Multiple approaches exist for any goal
- **Measurable progress**: All work contributes to measurable success metrics
- **Adaptive execution**: Plans as hypotheses, not contracts
- **Learning integration**: Implementation as hypothesis testing

## Key Commands

### Core Commands
