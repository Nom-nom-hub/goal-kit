# Vision Command (`/goalkit.vision`)

## Overview

The Vision command establishes your project foundation with a clear vision and guiding principles. It helps define the desired end state and success metrics that will guide all subsequent goal-setting and development activities.

## Purpose

The `/goalkit.vision` command is essential for:

- Establishing a clear project vision and desired end state
- Defining core principles that will guide development decisions
- Setting success metrics that will measure overall project achievement
- Identifying key stakeholders who will be impacted by or involved in the project
- Creating a high-level timeline with key phases for the project

## Usage

```
/goalkit.vision
Project: [Name of your project]
Vision Statement: [1-2 sentences describing the desired end state]
Core Principles: [3-5 guiding principles for the project]
Success Metrics: [Quantifiable measures of project success]
Stakeholders: [Key people impacted by or involved in the project]
Timeline: [High-level project timeline with key phases]
```

## Key Components

### Vision Statement
A concise 1-2 sentence description of the project's desired end state. This should be outcome-focused rather than implementation-focused.

### Core Principles
3-5 guiding principles that will inform all development decisions. These should reflect the values and priorities that will guide the project.

### Success Metrics
Quantifiable measures that will indicate project success. These should be specific, measurable, and tied to outcomes rather than just outputs.

### Stakeholders
Key people or groups who will be impacted by or involved in the project. Understanding stakeholders helps ensure the vision aligns with their needs.

### Timeline
A high-level timeline with key phases for the project. This doesn't need to be detailed but should provide a sense of the overall project scope and duration.

## Best Practices

- Keep the vision statement outcome-focused rather than implementation-focused
- Ensure core principles align with both business objectives and user needs
- Define success metrics that are quantitative and measurable
- Consider both internal and external stakeholders in your stakeholder analysis
- Make sure the timeline is realistic and accounts for potential learning and adaptation

4. Data-driven decision making
5. Continuous improvement based on learning
Success Metrics: 40% increase in customer satisfaction scores, 25% faster resolution of customer issues, 90% of feedback receiving acknowledged response within 48 hours
Stakeholders: Product team, customer support, end users, executive leadership

```

## Integration with Goal-Driven Development

The vision created with `/goalkit.vision` serves as the foundation for all subsequent Goal-Driven Development activities. It provides the context within which goals are defined, strategies are explored, and milestones are planned. Without a clear vision, goals may lack direction or coherence.
