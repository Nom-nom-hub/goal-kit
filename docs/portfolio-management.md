# Portfolio Management Guide

*How leaders manage all organizational goals as a cohesive portfolio.*

---

## Overview

Portfolio management is leadership's view of all goals across the organization. Instead of thinking goal-by-goal, portfolio thinking asks: *Are we allocating resources to the right priorities? Are we making progress on strategy? Are we at risk?*

Without portfolio management, teams execute in silos. With it, you have organizational clarity and can intervene when needed.

---

## What is a Portfolio?

A portfolio is a collection of all active goals organized by:
- **Status** (on track, at risk, completed)
- **Strategic pillar** (which company priorities they serve)
- **Team** (who's executing)
- **Resource allocation** (where are people spending time)

**Portfolio Dashboard** = Single document showing all this at once.

**See**: `templates/portfolio-template.md`

## Portfolio Status Assessment

### 🟢 On Track
**Indicators**:
- Completion % matches planned progress
- Metrics trending toward targets
- No major blockers
- Team confident in delivery

**Actions**:
- Keep going (celebrate progress)
- Check in bi-weekly
- Share updates with stakeholders

---

### 🟡 At Risk
**Indicators**:
- Completion % behind planned progress
- Metrics stalling or declining
- Blockers identified
- Timeline concerns

**Actions**:
1. **Understand the issue** - What happened?
2. **Quantify the impact** - How much slip? What KRs affected?
3. **Propose mitigation** - How do we recover?
   - Add resources?
   - Reduce scope?
   - Extend timeline?
4. **Decide** - Leadership approves mitigation plan
5. **Execute** - Goal owner implements plan
6. **Monitor** - Bi-weekly check-ins on recovery

---

### 🔴 Stopped / Blocked
**Indicators**:
- Work has paused (not by plan)
- External dependency blocking
- Unexpected showstopper

**Actions**:
1. **Decide immediately** - How long is pause? Is goal salvageable?
2. **Communicate** - What does this mean for dependent goals?
3. **Trigger escalation** - Dependent goal owners need to know
4. **Plan restart** - When can work resume?

---

### ✅ Completed
**Indicators**:
- All success criteria met
- Learnings captured
- Team ready to move on

**Actions**:
1. **Celebrate** - Team dinner, internal announcement
2. **Capture learnings** - Goal owner documents what was learned
3. **Share** - Present learnings at monthly portfolio review
4. **Archive** - Move goal to completed section
5. **Release capacity** - Team members move to next goal

---

## Portfolio Decisions

### Scope Change Mid-Goal
**Scenario**: Partway through execution, stakeholders request new features

**Process**:
1. Goal owner proposes scope change + impact estimate
2. Portfolio PM gathers data: timeline slip? Resource impact?
3. Leadership decides: Approve? Defer? Add resources?
4. Document decision + rationale in goal

**Decision Matrix**:
- **Approve**: Must be high-value AND has clear mitigation (extra resources, extend timeline)
- **Defer**: Most common—scope goes to next goal or stretch goal
- **Reject**: Not strategic; conflicts with vision

---

### Resource Reallocation
**Scenario**: Team A is over-allocated; Team B is under-allocated

**Process**:
1. Portfolio PM identifies over/under-allocation
2. Proposes reallocation (shift people between goals)
3. Goal owners + Team leads review impact
4. Leadership approves
5. Execute transition (knowledge transfer, ramp-up time)

**Reallocation Criteria**:
- ✅ Do it if: High-priority goal under-resourced; can move without hurting current goal
- ❌ Don't if: Mid-critical-path goal; shifting person would delay it

---

### Goal Cancellation
**Scenario**: Goal no longer aligns with strategy; market changed; KR is impossible

**Process**:
1. Goal owner or leadership proposes cancellation + rationale
2. Review impact: Are dependent goals affected?
3. Decision: Cancel immediately? Wind down gradually?
4. Communicate: Announce cancellation; celebrate work done; release team
5. Resource plan: Where do these people go next?

**Cancellation Criteria**:
- ✅ Do it if: Misaligned with strategy; market invalidated assumptions; impossible to achieve
- ❌ Don't if: Just got hard; owner lost confidence without data

## Dependency Management in Portfolio

### Cross-Goal Dependencies
**Problem**: Goal 008 blocks Goal 003 and 005; if Goal 008 slips, cascade impact

**Solution**:
1. **Map dependencies** - Create visible dependency graph
2. **Identify critical path** - Which sequence takes longest?
3. **Schedule sequentially** - High-priority/blocking goals first
4. **Buffer critical path** - Add contingency time
5. **Monitor blocking goals** - Extra scrutiny on goals that unblock others
6. **Plan handoffs** - Explicit dates when Goal 008 delivers to Goal 003

**Portfolio Dashboard Shows**:
```
Goal 008 (Infra Migration) ← CRITICAL PATH
  ↓ unblocks (Week 2)
Goal 003 (API Redesign) 
  ↓ unblocks (Week 5)
Goal 007 (Mobile Features)
  ↓ unblocks (Week 8)
Launch
```

### Cross-Team Dependencies
**Problem**: Goal 003 owned by Team A but needs input from Team B

**Solution**:
1. **Identify dependency type** - Data? API contract? Approval?
2. **Schedule handoff** - When does Team B need to deliver?
3. **Create coordination gate** - Explicit checkpoint when handoff happens
4. **Include in sync** - Bi-weekly sync includes dependency check
5. **Plan buffer** - Extra time in case handoff has issues

---

## Risk Management in Portfolio

### Risk Register
**Track at portfolio level**:
- What could block multiple goals?
- What's the probability? The impact?
- Who's mitigating?
- When should we escalate?

**Example**:
| Risk | Affected Goals | Impact | Probability | Mitigation | Owner | Escalate Date |
|------|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Key engineer departure | 003, 005, 008 | High | Medium | Cross-train 2 people; hire contractor | CTO | Feb 1 if not mitigated |
| Cloud provider outage | All | Medium | Low | Test failover to secondary | DevOps | If happens, immediate escalation |

### Risk Escalation
When to escalate a risk to leadership:
- ✅ High impact + Medium+ probability
- ✅ Affects 3+ goals / blocks KRs
- ✅ Mitigation beyond goal owner's control
- ❌ Low impact even if certain
- ❌ Single goal risk (goal owner handles)

---

## Portfolio Optimization

### Over-Allocation Patterns
**Pattern**: Same team always over-allocated

**Diagnosis**:
- Team taking on too much? (say no to goals)
- Team skills needed everywhere? (hiring, outsourcing)
- Portfolio imbalance? (strategically prioritizing this team)

**Fix**:
- Either increase capacity (hire)
- Or reduce scope (defer lower-priority goals)
- Or spread expertise (cross-train other teams)

---

### Under-Utilization Patterns
**Pattern**: Team finishing goals; sitting idle

**Diagnosis**:
- Pipeline of goals empty? (plan next quarter better)
- Team waiting for dependencies? (priority scheduling)
- Team not in roadmap? (ops work, tech debt)

**Fix**:
- Either add goals (pull forward lower-priority work)
- Or shift people (rebalance allocation)
- Or accept it (plan for Q2)

---

- Celebration of completions

### For All-Hands
*Monthly in company meeting*:
- Goals completed this month (celebrate!)
- Major milestones hit
- Key learnings to share
- Upcoming goals to watch for

### For Customers/Investors
*Quarterly/as-needed*:
- Goals delivering customer value (feature launches, reliability, performance)
- Roadmap aligned with customer feedback
- Timeline and confidence level

## Portfolio Common Mistakes

❌ **Not re-prioritizing when market changes**  
Instead: Quarterly review + flexibility to pivot goals mid-quarter if needed

❌ **Tolerating at-risk goals without action**  
Instead: Escalate immediately; don't wait for monthly meeting

❌ **Ignoring dependencies; allowing cascading failures**  
Instead: Map dependencies upfront; monitor critical path

❌ **Over-allocating teams to reach ambitious portfolio**  
Instead: Right-size portfolio to capacity; shipping 5 goals well beats 8 goals poorly

❌ **No visibility into team capacity**  
Instead: Track allocation monthly; surface over/under-utilization
