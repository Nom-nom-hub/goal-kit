# Benchmark Command (`/goalkit.benchmark`)

## Overview

The Benchmark command establishes performance baselines and comparison metrics to evaluate implementation effectiveness against standards, competitors, or alternative approaches. It provides quantitative measures for assessing system performance and optimization opportunities.

## Purpose

The `/goalkit.benchmark` command is essential for:

- Establishing baseline performance metrics before implementing changes
- Comparing performance across different implementation strategies
- Measuring improvements against established goals and success criteria
- Validating that performance meets required standards and user expectations
- Identifying optimization opportunities for goal achievement

## Usage

```
/goalkit.benchmark [description of performance aspects to benchmark and comparison criteria]
```

## Key Components

### Benchmark Criteria
Specific performance metrics that will be measured, such as response time, throughput, resource utilization, or user experience metrics.

### Baseline Measurements
Initial measurements taken before implementing changes to establish comparison points.

### Testing Scenarios
Specific scenarios and conditions under which benchmarks will be performed to ensure consistency.

### Comparison Standards
Standards, competitors, or alternative approaches against which performance will be compared.

### Reporting Format
Structure for presenting benchmark results in a clear, actionable manner.

## Best Practices

- Establish benchmarks before implementing changes to have valid comparison points
- Use realistic testing scenarios that reflect actual usage patterns
- Document testing conditions to ensure reproducibility
- Compare benchmarks against goal success criteria and industry standards
- Regularly update benchmarks as systems and requirements evolve
- Share benchmark results with stakeholders to inform decision-making

## Example

```
/goalkit.benchmark Establish performance benchmarks for the authentication system: measure login response time, concurrent user capacity, database query performance, and security validation speed. Compare against industry standards and the goal of achieving sub-3-second response time. Document current baseline performance before implementing new security features, and set up regular benchmarking to ensure performance continues to meet requirements.
```

## Integration with Goal-Driven Development

Benchmarks provide objective measures for evaluating whether implementations are meeting performance-related goals and success criteria. This command supports the Goal-Driven Development principle of measurable progress by establishing quantitative measures for performance aspects of goal achievement. Benchmarks enable evidence-based decisions about strategy effectiveness and help identify when adaptations are needed to meet performance goals.
