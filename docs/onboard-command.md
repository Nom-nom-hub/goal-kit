The onboarding command ensures that all participants in the goal-driven development process understand the methodology and their role in achieving defined goals. Effective onboarding maintains consistency in the approach across team changes and supports the methodology's emphasis on alignment around outcomes rather than implementation details. It ensures that new participants can contribute effectively to goal achievement while maintaining the collaborative approach needed for strategy exploration and adaptation.
