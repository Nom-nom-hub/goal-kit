# Tasks Command (`/goalkit.tasks`)

## Overview

The Tasks command organizes and manages specific activities needed to achieve goals within the goal-driven development framework. It breaks down milestones and strategies into actionable tasks while maintaining focus on outcome achievement.

## Purpose

The `/goalkit.tasks` command is essential for:

- Breaking down goals and milestones into specific, actionable tasks
- Organizing work in a way that supports goal achievement
- Tracking progress at the granular task level
- Ensuring all activities contribute directly to defined goals
- Coordinating task completion with team members and stakeholders

## Usage

```
/goalkit.tasks [description of task management needs and specific activities to organize]
```

## Key Components

### Task Definition
Clear, specific definition of tasks needed for goal achievement.

### Goal Alignment
Connection between each task and specific goals or success criteria.

### Task Prioritization
Ranking of tasks based on their impact on goal achievement.

### Progress Tracking
Mechanisms for monitoring task completion and its impact on goals.

### Coordination Framework
Structure for coordinating tasks among team members and stakeholders.

## Best Practices

- Ensure every task directly contributes to goal achievement
- Align task priorities with goal success criteria
- Break down complex tasks to make progress measurable
- Regularly update task status in relation to goal progress
- Communicate task dependencies that could impact goal achievement
- Use tasks to support, not replace, focus on outcomes

## Example

```
/goalkit.tasks Organize tasks needed to achieve our authentication system goals: create specific tasks for designing secure password storage, implementing MFA options, testing login performance, gathering user feedback, and validating security measures. Prioritize tasks based on their impact on achieving our 99.9% login success rate and 4.5+/5 user satisfaction goals. Organize tasks into sprints that align with our milestone schedule and include validation tasks that measure progress toward our goals.
```

## Integration with Goal-Driven Development

The tasks command supports the Goal-Driven Development methodology by translating high-level goals and strategies into specific, actionable items. While maintaining the focus on outcomes, it provides the structure needed for day-to-day execution. Tasks ensure that all activities contribute directly to goal achievement while providing granular progress tracking that supports the methodology's emphasis on measurable progress and adaptive execution.
