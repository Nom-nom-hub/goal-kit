# Research Command (`/goalkit.research`)

## Overview

The Research command conducts systematic investigation of topics, technologies, markets, or user needs relevant to goal achievement. It provides evidence-based insights to inform strategy decisions and goal refinement.

## Purpose

The `/goalkit.research` command is essential for:

- Conducting systematic investigation of topics relevant to goal achievement
- Gathering evidence to inform strategy decisions
- Understanding user needs, market conditions, or technical considerations
- Validating assumptions before committing to specific approaches
- Providing knowledge foundation for informed decision-making

## Usage

```
/goalkit.research [description of research topic and specific questions to answer]
```

## Key Components

### Research Objectives
Clear definition of what knowledge or insights the research aims to uncover.

### Methodology
Approach and methods that will be used to gather and analyze information.

### Information Sources
Specific sources of information that will be consulted during research.

### Analysis Framework
Structure for organizing and analyzing researched information.

### Application Plan
How research findings will be applied to goal achievement or strategy development.

## Best Practices

- Align research topics directly with current goals and challenges
- Use multiple sources to validate research findings
- Focus research on questions that will impact strategy decisions
- Document research methodology and sources for transparency
- Share research findings with relevant stakeholders
- Connect research outcomes to specific actions or decisions

## Example

```
/goalkit.research Investigate user preferences for authentication methods among our target demographic: research which authentication methods users prefer (password, biometric, social login), understand their security concerns, and identify friction points in current authentication experiences. Use survey data, user interviews, and competitor analysis to gather insights that will inform our strategy for achieving our user satisfaction goal of 4.5+/5. Apply findings to prioritize authentication features in our next milestone.
```

## Integration with Goal-Driven Development

The research command supports the Goal-Driven Development methodology by providing evidence-based insights that inform strategy decisions. Research helps validate assumptions about approaches before committing resources to implementation, supporting the methodology's emphasis on hypothesis testing. It provides the knowledge foundation needed to make informed decisions about strategy selection and adaptation, ensuring that efforts are directed toward approaches most likely to achieve defined goals.
