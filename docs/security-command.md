# Security Command (`/goalkit.security`)

## Overview

The Security command addresses security considerations in the context of goal achievement, ensuring that security requirements are integrated into strategies and implemented without compromising goal outcomes.

## Purpose

The `/goalkit.security` command is essential for:

- Integrating security requirements with goal achievement
- Ensuring security considerations don't compromise desired outcomes
- Balancing security measures with user experience and performance goals
- Creating security-aware strategies that support overall objectives
- Planning for security validation and compliance within goal-driven development

## Usage

```
/goalkit.security [description of security requirements and considerations for goal achievement]
```

## Key Components

### Security Requirements
Specific security standards, regulations, or requirements that apply to the project.

### Security-Goal Alignment
Integration of security needs with goal success criteria and strategies.

### Security Implementation
Approach to implementing security measures without compromising user experience or performance.

### Compliance Considerations
Requirements for regulatory or organizational compliance in security implementation.

### Security Validation
Methods for validating security measures while maintaining focus on goal achievement.

## Best Practices

- Align security measures with goal success criteria rather than treating security as separate
- Consider security implications of different strategies during exploration
- Balance security depth with user experience and performance goals
- Include security validation in milestone planning and execution
- Plan for security audits while maintaining adaptive execution flexibility
- Document security decisions and their impact on goal achievement

## Example

```
/goalkit.security Integrate security requirements into our authentication system goals: ensure all approaches to achieving 99.9% login success rate and 4.5+/5 user satisfaction meet security standards. Evaluate different authentication strategies (password, MFA, biometric) for both security strength and user experience impact. Plan security validation and penetration testing within our milestone schedule, ensuring security measures don't compromise our sub-3-second response time goal. Include security considerations in our strategy comparison framework.
```

## Integration with Goal-Driven Development

The security command ensures that security considerations are integrated into the goal-driven development process without compromising the focus on outcomes. It supports the methodology by ensuring that security requirements are balanced with other goal success criteria, preventing security from becoming a barrier to adaptive execution and learning. This command maintains the methodology's emphasis on measurable outcomes while ensuring that security objectives are met.
