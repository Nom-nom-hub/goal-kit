# Goal Kit Documentation

Welcome to the Goal Kit documentation. Goal Kit implements Goal-Driven Development, a methodology that focuses on outcomes and learning rather than detailed upfront specifications.

## What is Goal Kit?

Goal Kit is a comprehensive toolkit for implementing Goal-Driven Development (GDD) methodology. It transforms software development from task execution to outcome achievement by providing structured commands and processes that focus on measurable results.

## Core Philosophy

Goal-Driven Development emphasizes:

- **Outcome-First**: Prioritize user and business outcomes
- **Strategy Flexibility**: Multiple valid approaches for any goal
- **Measurement-Driven**: Progress must be measured and validated
- **Learning Integration**: Treat implementation as hypothesis testing
- **Adaptive Planning**: Change course based on evidence

## Key Commands

- `/goalkit.vision` - Establish project vision and principles
- `/goalkit.goal` - Define goals and success criteria
- `/goalkit.strategies` - Explore implementation strategies
- `/goalkit.milestones` - Create measurable milestones
- `/goalkit.execute` - Execute with learning and adaptation


## Documentation Sections

1. [Goal-Driven Development Methodology](./goal-driven.md) - Complete methodology overview
2. [Comparison with Traditional Approaches](./comparison.md) - Differences from spec-driven development
3. [Practical Examples](./examples.md) - Real-world usage scenarios
4. [Command Reference](./toc.md) - Detailed command documentation

## Quick Start

1. Install the Goalkeeper CLI:
   ```bash
   uv tool install goalkeeper-cli --from git+https://github.com/Nom-nom-hub/goal-kit.git
   ```

2. Initialize a project:
   ```bash
   goalkeeper init <PROJECT_NAME>
   ```

3. Begin with vision setting:
   ```bash
   /goalkit.vision Create a vision focused on user outcomes and measurable success
   ```

## Supported AI Agents

Goal Kit works with all major AI coding assistants:
- Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI, Cursor, Qwen Code, opencode, Codex CLI, Windsurf, Kilo Code, Auggie CLI, Roo Code, Amazon Q Developer CLI
