# Track Command (`/goalkit.track`)

## Overview

The Track command establishes systems for monitoring progress toward goals, measuring success metrics, and providing visibility into the effectiveness of different strategies. It ensures continuous awareness of goal achievement status.

## Purpose

The `/goalkit.track` command is essential for:

- Creating systems for continuous monitoring of goal progress
- Tracking success metrics and key performance indicators
- Monitoring the effectiveness of different strategies
- Providing real-time visibility into goal achievement status
- Supporting data-driven decision making for adaptations

## Usage

```
/goalkit.track [description of tracking requirements and metrics to monitor]
```

## Key Components

### Progress Tracking
Systems for monitoring advancement toward defined goals and milestones.

### Metric Monitoring
Continuous tracking of success metrics and key performance indicators.

### Strategy Effectiveness
Measurement of how different strategies are performing relative to goals.

### Alert Systems
Mechanisms for identifying when goals are at risk or strategies need adjustment.

### Reporting Framework
Regular reporting on tracked metrics and goal status.

## Best Practices

- Track metrics that directly align with goal success criteria
- Implement real-time monitoring where possible for quick insights
- Create dashboards that provide clear visibility into goal progress
- Set up alerts for when metrics indicate risks to goal achievement
- Regularly review tracking effectiveness and adjust as needed
- Share tracking insights with relevant stakeholders for transparency

## Example

```
/goalkit.track Set up tracking for our authentication system goals: monitor login success rate in real-time, track user satisfaction scores through regular surveys, measure response times continuously, and monitor security incidents. Create dashboards that show progress toward our 99.9% login success rate and 4.5+/5 user satisfaction goals. Set up alerts when success rates drop below 98% or user satisfaction falls below 4.0/5.0. Track the effectiveness of different authentication strategies as we implement them to guide future strategy selection.
```

## Integration with Goal-Driven Development

The track command supports the Goal-Driven Development methodology by providing the monitoring systems needed to measure progress toward goals and evaluate strategy effectiveness. Tracking enables the continuous awareness necessary for adaptive execution, allowing teams to respond quickly when strategies aren't achieving desired outcomes. This command ensures that the methodology's emphasis on measurable progress is supported by appropriate monitoring systems.
