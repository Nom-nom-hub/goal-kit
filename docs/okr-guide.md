# OKR Guide

*How to set and manage quarterly OKRs with Goal Kit.*

---

## What Are OKRs?

**OKR = Objectives + Key Results**

- **Objective**: Qualitative outcome you want to achieve (the "what")
- **Key Result**: 3-4 measurable proof points that prove you achieved it (the "how much")

**Example**:
```
Objective: Become the fastest-shipping product platform
  KR 1: Ship 5 major features
  KR 2: Achieve >90% adoption of new features
  KR 3: Reduce feature cycle time from 8 weeks to 4 weeks
```

If all 3 KRs are achieved, you've proven the objective. Simple.

---

## Why Use OKRs with Goal Kit?

**Problem without OKRs**: Teams execute goals, but you don't know if you're progressing toward business objectives.

**Solution with OKRs**: Goals are the "how"; OKRs are the "why" and "how much."

**Goal Kit + OKRs workflow**:
```
Organization Vision
  ↓ (defines long-term direction)
Quarterly OKRs
  ↓ (focus quarterly priorities)
Goals
  ↓ (execute to achieve OKRs)
Success Criteria & Metrics
  ↓ (measure goal progress)
Goal Completions
  ↓ (prove OKR achievement)
```

## OKR Cadence

### Quarterly OKRs
Most common. Set them quarterly (e.g., Q1: Jan-Mar).

**Timeline**:
- **Week 1 of planning**: Leadership drafts OKRs
- **Week 2**: All-hands discussion + feedback
- **Week 3**: Finalize + publish OKRs
- **During quarter**: Weekly/monthly progress tracking
- **End of quarter**: Measure achievement + retrospective

**Example calendar**:
- **Q1**: Jan 1 - Mar 31 (Planning in Dec)
- **Q2**: Apr 1 - Jun 30 (Planning in Mar)
- **Q3**: Jul 1 - Sep 30 (Planning in Jun)
- **Q4**: Oct 1 - Dec 31 (Planning in Sep)

---

### Annual OKRs (Optional)
Some organizations use annual OKRs at top level:

- **Pros**: Stability, longer-term focus
- **Cons**: Less flexibility, miss market changes
- **Best practice**: Combine both—annual vision + quarterly OKRs

---

## OKR Structure

### 1 Objective = 3-4 Key Results

**Per organization, 3-5 objectives per quarter.**

### Example OKRs (Good Structure)

```
Q1 2025 Objectives

Objective 1: Become the fastest-shipping platform
  KR 1.1: Ship 5 major features
  KR 1.2: Achieve >90% adoption on new features
  KR 1.3: Reduce feature cycle time from 8 → 4 weeks

Objective 2: Build the industry's best engineering team
  KR 2.1: Hire 3 senior engineers
  KR 2.2: Achieve 85+ eNPS (employee satisfaction)
  KR 2.3: Complete skill development for 20+ engineers

Objective 3: Expand into enterprise market
  KR 3.1: Close 5 enterprise customers
  KR 3.2: Achieve 4.7+ NPS from enterprise users
  KR 3.3: Build SOC2 compliance certification

Objective 4: Reduce operational toil
  KR 4.1: Achieve 99.9% uptime (SLA)
  KR 4.2: Reduce on-call incidents by 50%
  KR 4.3: Automate 30% of DevOps tasks
```

**Why this structure works**:
- 4 clear bets for the quarter (not 10)
- Each OKR has 3-4 measurable outcomes
- Mix of product (1), team (2), market (3), operations (4)
- Each is clearly the responsibility of a different exec

---

## Setting OKRs: Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Assess Previous Quarter
- How did we do on last quarter's OKRs?
- What worked? What didn't?
- What did we learn?

**Example assessment**:
```
Q4 OKR 1: "Ship 5 features"
- Result: Shipped 3 features (60% achievement)
- Why: Underestimated complexity of feature #4; took twice as long
- Learning: Need better estimation; should have reduced scope or extended timeline
- Implication for Q1: Be more conservative on feature count; focus on quality
```

---

### Step 2: Understand Business Context
Ask:
- What's our 3-year vision? (from org vision document)
- What strategic pillars are we prioritizing?
- What market changes do we need to respond to?
- What customer feedback are we hearing?
- What capabilities do we need to build?

---

### Step 3: Draft OKRs (Leadership)
Leadership team brainstorms 3-5 OKRs without constraints.

**Guidelines**:
- **Broad strokes only** - "Become the fastest shipping" not "Refactor 23 services"
- **Aspirational** - Should be 70-80% confident, not 100%
- **Measurable** - Should be provable (not "improve quality")
- **Bold** - OKRs should stretch the team
- **Limited** - Max 5 per quarter (focus!)

**Bad OKRs**:
- ❌ "Write better code" (not measurable)
- ❌ "Hire 100 engineers" (too aggressive; maybe not possible)
- ❌ "Fix 500 bugs" (task, not outcome)
- ❌ "Complete design documentation" (task, not outcome)

**Good OKRs**:
- ✅ "Become the fastest-shipping platform" (aspirational, measurable with KRs)
- ✅ "Build industry-best team" (aspirational, measurable with KRs)
- ✅ "Achieve 99.9% uptime" (specific, measurable, realistic)

---

### Step 4: Set Key Results
For each objective, define 3-4 measurable key results.

**Characteristics of good KRs**:
- **Specific**: "Achieve 90% adoption" not "Improve adoption"
- **Measurable**: Can be verified objectively
- **Achievable but Ambitious**: 70-80% confidence
- **Time-bound**: By end of Q1, not "eventually"
- **Distinct**: Each KR proves a different dimension

**Example**:

```
Objective: Ship product that customers love
  ❌ Bad KRs:
     - KR 1: Ship features (not measurable)
     - KR 2: Make product better (too vague)
     - KR 3: Fix bugs (no target)
     - KR 4: Update documentation (task)
     - KR 5: Improve code quality (5 KRs is too many)

  ✅ Good KRs:
     - KR 1: Ship 5 major features (specific count)
     - KR 2: Achieve >90% adoption on new features (measurable threshold)
     - KR 3: Improve NPS from 45 → 55 (baseline + target)
```

---

### Step 5: All-Hands Discussion
Present draft OKRs to full company. Gather feedback:
- Does this align with vision?
- Do we believe we can achieve it?
- What's missing?
- Any concerns?

**Output**: Refined OKRs based on feedback

---

### Step 6: Assign Owners
Each KR gets an owner (usually exec).

```
KR 1.1: Ship 5 major features
  Owner: VP Product
  Collaborators: VP Engineering, Design Lead

KR 2.1: Hire 3 senior engineers
  Owner: VP People
  Collaborators: VP Engineering
```

**Owner's job**:
- Drives progress toward KR
- Reports status weekly
- Escalates blockers
- Makes decisions in their domain

---

### Step 7: Link Goals to OKRs
As teams plan goals for Q1, map each goal to KRs it supports.

**See**: `templates/okr-mapping-template.md`

```
Goal 003: Real-Time Collaboration Features
  Supports KR 1.1 (1 of 5 features) - 20%
  Supports KR 1.2 (enables adoption of feature) - 50%
  Supports KR 1.3 (fast feature shipping practice) - 20%
```

---

## Tracking OKRs During the Quarter

### Weekly Check-Ins
Each KR owner updates status:
- **Status**: On track / At risk / Off track
- **Progress**: [Current progress toward target]
- **Confidence**: [% confident we'll achieve this KR by EOQ]
- **Issues**: [Any blockers?]

**Format**: Async in shared doc or Slack

**Example**:
```
KR 1.1: Ship 5 major features
  Status: On track
  Progress: Feature #1 completed (week 4), Feature #2 at 60% (week 8 target)
  Confidence: 85% (if no major delays)
  Issues: Feature #3 waiting on API redesign (Goal 008); monitoring
```

---

### Mid-Quarter Check-In (Week 6-8 of quarter)
Leadership reviews all OKRs:
- How are we tracking? (% complete)
- What's at risk? (which KRs?)
- Do we need to adjust? (reduce scope? extend timeline? pivot strategy?)
- Resource constraints? (do we have what we need?)

**Possible outcomes**:
- ✅ Continue as planned (tracking well)
- ⚠️ Adjust scope (reduce targets, extend timeline)
- 🔄 Pivot strategy (approach isn't working; try different angle)
- 🚫 Abandon (market changed; no longer relevant)

---

### End-of-Quarter Review (Last week of quarter)
Measure achievement:

```
Q1 Results:

Objective 1: Fastest-shipping platform
  KR 1.1: Ship 5 features → Result: 4 features (80% achieved)
  KR 1.2: >90% adoption → Result: 88% (nearly achieved)
  KR 1.3: 4-week cycle → Result: 5.5 weeks (partial progress)
  Overall: 3 of 3 KRs achieved (high confidence in progress)

Objective 2: Industry-best team
  KR 2.1: Hire 3 engineers → Result: 2 hired, 1 offer pending (67%)
  KR 2.2: 85+ eNPS → Result: 78 eNPS (missed, but improved from 72)
  KR 2.3: 20+ skill development → Result: 15 engineers completed (75%)
  Overall: 2 of 3 KRs achieved (team capability improving)

Overall Company Performance: 5 of 6 KRs achieved (83% success rate)
```

## Scoring OKRs

### Scoring System

| Achievement | Score | Interpretation |
|------------|-------|-----------------|
| >100% | 1.0 | Exceeded target (was too conservative) |
| 90-100% | 0.9 | Achieved target (strong execution) |
| 70-89% | 0.7 | Partial achievement (good progress) |
| 50-69% | 0.5 | Low achievement (significant miss) |
| <50% | 0.0 | Not achieved (major miss) |

### Example Scoring

```
Q1 OKRs Scorecard:

Objective 1: Fastest-shipping platform (Score: 0.8)
  KR 1.1: 4 of 5 features (0.8)
  KR 1.2: 88% adoption (0.9)
  KR 1.3: 5.5-week cycle (0.7)
  Average: 0.8

Objective 2: Best team (Score: 0.7)
  KR 2.1: 2 of 3 hires (0.7)
  KR 2.2: 78 eNPS (0.6)
  KR 2.3: 15 of 20 (0.75)
  Average: 0.7

Company Overall Score: 0.75 (75% achievement)
```

**Interpretation**:
- **0.8+**: Strong quarter (70-80% target is right level)
- **0.5-0.7**: Mixed results (need to figure out what went wrong)
- **<0.5**: Major misses (reassess goals, capacity, or execution)

---

## OKR Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Too many OKRs** (7+)  
Instead: 3-5 per quarter. More than this = can't focus

❌ **KRs that are tasks**  
❌ Bad: "Write API documentation"  
Instead: "Achieve 95% API adoption among customers"

❌ **100% confidence on all KRs**  
Instead: 70-80% confidence (stretch goals)

❌ **No goals mapping to OKRs**  
Instead: Every goal in OKR quarter maps to at least one KR

❌ **OKRs never mentioned during the quarter**  
Instead: Weekly updates, mid-quarter check-in, end-of-quarter review

❌ **Blaming teams when OKRs missed**  
Instead: Ask "What did we learn? How do we improve next quarter?"

❌ **Never adjusting OKRs when circumstances change**  
Instead: Mid-quarter review allows pivot if market changes

## OKRs vs. Goals in Goal Kit

| Aspect | OKR | Goal |
|--------|-----|------|
| **Timeframe** | Quarterly | 1-4 months |
| **Scope** | Org-wide | Team/function |
| **Purpose** | Strategic focus | Execution vehicle |
| **Measurement** | End-of-quarter | Ongoing + completion |
| **Flexibility** | Can pivot mid-quarter | Should complete as planned |
| **Owner** | Exec (VP/C-level) | Individual contributor |

**Relationship**: OKRs guide which goals to create. Goals are how you execute OKRs.

```
OKR: Ship 5 features
  ↑
  ↓ (how to achieve)
Goal 1: Real-time collaboration
Goal 2: Mobile support
Goal 3: Advanced analytics
(+ 2 more goals)
```

## OKR Common Questions

**Q: Should every goal map to an OKR?**  
A: Goals created during OKR quarter should map to OKRs. Ongoing work (tech debt, security, operations) may not map—that's okay, document why.

**Q: What if we miss an OKR?**  
A: Not a failure—it means you learned the goal was ambitious. Ask:
- Did we execute well? (Yes = good effort, ambitious goal)
- Did circumstances change? (Yes = pivot decision was right)
- Did we underestimate? (Yes = better estimation next time)

**Q: Can we change OKRs mid-quarter?**  
A: Rarely, but allowed:
- ✅ Do it if: Market pivots, customer opportunity emerges, external blocker
- ❌ Don't do it if: Goal got hard; owner lost confidence; just impatient

**Q: How many KRs per objective?**  
A: 3-4. More than 4 = too many measurables. Fewer than 3 = not enough proof.

**Q: Can different teams have different OKRs?**  
A: Yes, but recommend:
- **Org-level OKRs** (everyone contributes)
- **Team-level OKRs** (optional, for nuanced goals)
- Map team goals to org OKRs (show cascade)
