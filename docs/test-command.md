# Test Command (`/goalkit.test`)

## Overview

The Test command establishes testing approaches and frameworks that validate goal achievement while supporting the adaptive nature of goal-driven development. It ensures that testing activities contribute to measuring and validating success criteria.

## Purpose

The `/goalkit.test` command is essential for:

- Creating testing strategies that validate goal achievement
- Establishing test frameworks that support adaptive execution
- Ensuring tests measure success criteria rather than just functionality
- Maintaining quality while preserving flexibility for strategy adaptation
- Creating tests that validate different implementation strategies

## Usage

```
/goalkit.test [description of testing requirements and validation needs for goals]
```

## Key Components

### Goal-Based Testing
Testing approaches focused on validating goal success criteria rather than just features.

### Adaptive Test Frameworks
Testing systems that accommodate different implementation strategies.

### Validation Criteria
Specific criteria that indicate goal achievement has been validated.

### Quality Standards
Quality measures that support rather than hinder adaptive execution.

### Test Maintenance
Approaches for maintaining tests as strategies and implementations evolve.

## Best Practices

- Align test objectives with goal success criteria
- Design tests that validate different strategies for achieving goals
- Focus on outcome-validation tests rather than implementation-specific tests
- Create robust tests that don't break with strategy adaptations
- Balance test coverage with development flexibility
- Use testing to support learning and validation rather than just verification

## Example

```
/goalkit.test Create testing strategy for our authentication system goals: develop tests that validate we achieve 99.9% login success rate and 4.5+/5 user satisfaction. Create performance tests that validate our sub-3-second response time, security tests that ensure our zero security breach goal is met, and user experience tests that validate the effectiveness of different authentication approaches. Design tests that can validate multiple strategy implementations (password, MFA, biometric) without requiring test rewrites for each strategy change.
```

## Integration with Goal-Driven Development

The test command supports the Goal-Driven Development methodology by creating validation frameworks that measure goal achievement rather than just implementation details. Testing in this context becomes a tool for validating that strategies are effective at achieving desired outcomes, supporting the methodology's emphasis on measurable progress and evidence-based adaptation. This command ensures that quality and validation activities enhance rather than hinder the adaptive execution process.
