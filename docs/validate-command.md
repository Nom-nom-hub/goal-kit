# Validate Command (`/goalkit.validate`)

## Overview

The Validate command verifies that implementations, strategies, and progress are aligned with goal success criteria. It provides systematic verification that efforts are moving toward desired outcomes rather than just completing activities.

## Purpose

The `/goalkit.validate` command is essential for:

- Verifying that implementations meet goal success criteria
- Confirming that strategies are effectively contributing to goal achievement
- Ensuring that progress measures accurately reflect goal advancement
- Validating assumptions and hypotheses throughout the development process
- Providing checkpoint assessments to guide adaptation decisions

## Usage

```
/goalkit.validate [description of validation requirements and specific elements to validate]
```

## Key Components

### Goal Alignment Validation
Verification that implementations align with defined goals and success criteria.

### Strategy Validation
Assessment of whether current strategies are effectively achieving goals.

### Implementation Validation
Verification that actual implementations meet quality and effectiveness standards.

### Assumption Validation
Testing of key assumptions that underlie strategy choices.

### Progress Validation
Verification that measured progress accurately reflects advancement toward goals.

## Best Practices

- Regularly validate progress against goal success criteria rather than just activity completion
- Validate assumptions before committing significant resources to strategies
- Use multiple validation methods to ensure comprehensive assessment
- Validate early and often to catch misalignments quickly
- Document validation findings and their implications for goal achievement
- Base adaptation decisions on validation results rather than assumptions

## Example

```
/goalkit.validate Verify that our current authentication system implementation is on track to achieve our goals: validate that our 97.2% current login success rate is trending toward our 99.9% target, assess whether our current strategy will achieve the sub-3-second response time goal, and validate user satisfaction through direct feedback to ensure we're on track for our 4.5+/5 target. Check that our security implementations meet the zero-breach goal requirements. Use validation results to decide whether to continue current approaches or adapt strategies.
```

## Integration with Goal-Driven Development

The validate command is fundamental to the Goal-Driven Development methodology, providing the verification systems needed to ensure that efforts are truly advancing toward defined goals. Validation supports the methodology's emphasis on measurable progress and adaptive execution by providing the evidence needed to make informed decisions about strategy continuation or adaptation. This command ensures that the approach remains grounded in actual progress toward outcomes rather than just implementation activities.
