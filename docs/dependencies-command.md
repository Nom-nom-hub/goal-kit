# Dependencies Command (`/goalkit.dependencies`)

## Overview

The Dependencies command manages external libraries, services, and resources that are required for goal achievement, ensuring proper tracking, versioning, and risk management of all project dependencies.

## Purpose

The `/goalkit.dependencies` command is essential for:

- Identifying and tracking all external dependencies needed for goal achievement
- Managing version compatibility and security of dependencies
- Assessing risks associated with external dependencies
- Planning for dependency updates and potential replacements
- Ensuring dependencies align with project goals and technical requirements

## Usage

```
/goalkit.dependencies [description of dependency requirements, management approach, and risk considerations]
```

## Key Components

### Dependency Inventory
Comprehensive list of all external libraries, services, APIs, and resources the project depends on.

### Version Management
Strategy for managing versions of dependencies to ensure compatibility and security.

### Risk Assessment
Evaluation of risks associated with each dependency, including security vulnerabilities, maintenance status, and vendor reliability.

### Alternative Planning
Planning for potential alternatives in case critical dependencies become unavailable or unsuitable.

### Dependency Validation
Processes for validating that dependencies continue to meet project needs and security standards.

## Best Practices

- Regularly review and update dependency lists to reflect current project needs
- Prioritize dependencies based on criticality to goal achievement
- Maintain security standards for all dependencies
- Plan for dependency version updates and potential replacements
- Document the rationale for choosing specific dependencies
- Monitor dependencies for security issues and maintenance status

## Example

```
/goalkit.dependencies Analyze dependencies for the authentication system: identify all external libraries for encryption, token management, and user validation. Assess security risks for each dependency, plan for regular updates, and identify backup solutions in case primary dependencies become unsupported. Ensure all dependencies meet the security requirements defined in our goal of zero security breaches. Include a strategy for evaluating new dependencies against our performance goals (sub-3 second response time) and security requirements.
```

## Integration with Goal-Driven Development

Effective dependency management supports goal achievement by ensuring that external resources continue to support the project's objectives. The dependencies command helps identify potential risks that could impact goal achievement and enables proactive management of these risks. Proper dependency management ensures that the technical foundation supports the flexibility needed for strategy adaptation while maintaining stability for goal measurement and achievement.
