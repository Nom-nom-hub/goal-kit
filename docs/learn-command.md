# Learn Command (`/goalkit.learn`)

## Overview

The Learn command facilitates systematic learning from development experiences, experiments, and outcomes. It structures the capture and application of knowledge to improve future goal achievement and strategy effectiveness.

## Purpose

The `/goalkit.learn` command is essential for:

- Capturing lessons learned from goal achievement attempts
- Structuring knowledge gained during implementation
- Improving future strategy selection and execution
- Creating organizational learning from project experiences
- Supporting adaptive execution based on gained insights

## Usage

```
/goalkit.learn [description of learning opportunity, experience, or outcome to extract lessons from]
```

## Key Components

### Learning Objective
Clear statement of what is being learned or what knowledge is being sought.

### Experience Documentation
Detailed record of what was tried, implemented, or experimented with.

### Outcome Analysis
Analysis of results and outcomes of the experience or experiment.

### Lesson Extraction
Specific lessons learned from the experience that can guide future decisions.

### Application Plan
How the learned knowledge will be applied to future goal achievement.

## Best Practices

- Document learning immediately after experiences while details are fresh
- Connect learning to specific goals and strategies
- Share learning across the team and organization
- Use learning to inform strategy adaptation and improvement
- Create a systematic process for capturing and applying learning
- Focus on understanding both successes and failures

## Example

```
/goalkit.learn Document lessons from the first milestone of our authentication system: we implemented JWT-based authentication but discovered it was causing performance bottlenecks under load testing. The lesson is that for high-volume systems, we need to consider tokenless authentication approaches for better performance. Apply this learning by reassessing our strategy for the next milestone and considering alternative authentication approaches that better meet our performance goals (sub-3 second response time).
```

## Integration with Goal-Driven Development

Learning is fundamental to the Goal-Driven Development methodology, enabling adaptive execution and strategy improvement based on evidence. The learn command supports the methodology's emphasis on treating implementation as hypothesis testing by facilitating systematic capture and application of knowledge gained from experiences. This command ensures that learning is intentionally captured and applied to improve future goal achievement rather than being lost or forgotten.
