## üåü What is Goal-Driven Development?

Goal-Driven Development **focuses on outcomes over specifications**. While Spec-Driven Development creates detailed specifications that generate specific implementations, Goal-Driven Development starts with high-level goals and explores multiple strategies to achieve them.

### Key Differences from Spec-Driven Development:

| Spec-Driven Development | Goal-Driven Development |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| Detailed specifications upfront | High-level goals and outcomes |
| Single implementation path | Multiple strategies exploration |
| Requirements-focused | Metrics and success-focused |
| Implementation precision | Outcome flexibility |

## ‚ö° Quick Start

### 1. Install Goalkeeper

Choose your preferred installation method:

#### Option 1: Persistent Installation (Recommended)

Install once and use everywhere:

```bash
uv tool install goalkeeper-cli --from git+https://github.com/Nom-nom-hub/goal-kit.git
```

Then use the tool directly:

```bash
goalkeeper init <PROJECT_NAME>
goalkeeper check
```

#### Option 2: One-time Usage

Run directly without installing:

```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/Nom-nom-hub/goal-kit.git goalkeeper init <PROJECT_NAME>
```

### 2. Establish project vision

Use the **`/goalkit.vision`** command to create your project's purpose, values, and success criteria that will guide all subsequent development.

```bash
/goalkit.vision Create a vision focused on user outcomes, business metrics, and flexible achievement strategies
```

### 3. Define goals

Use the **`/goalkit.goal`** command to describe what outcomes you want to achieve. Focus on the **why** and **what success looks like**, not the implementation.

```bash
/goalkit.goal Build an application that helps users achieve [specific outcome] with measurable success criteria
```

### 4. Explore strategies

Use the **`/goalkit.strategies`** command to explore multiple approaches for achieving your goals.

```bash
/goalkit.strategies Consider different technical approaches, user experience patterns, and implementation strategies
```

### 5. Set milestones

Use **`/goalkit.milestones`** to create measurable milestones from your strategies.

```bash
/goalkit.milestones
```

### 6. Execute with flexibility

Use **`/goalkit.execute`** to begin implementation with continuous learning and adaptation. This command helps structure your execution approach, focusing on measurable progress and evidence-based adjustments.

```bash
/goalkit.execute
```

### 7. Collaborate and coordinate (New!)

Use **`/goalkit.collaborate`** to coordinate work between multiple agents or maintain consistency in single-agent environments. This command creates collaboration plans that track dependencies, communication, and progress across development activities.

```bash
/goalkit.collaborate Coordinate work between frontend and backend development
```

### 8. Persona Management (Advanced!)

Switch between specialized agent personas for different development tasks. The agent can take on specific roles like GitHub specialist, milestone planner, strategy explorer, QA specialist, or documentation expert.

```bash
/goalkit.persona [persona-name]  # Switch to a specific persona
/goalkit.persona github          # Switch to GitHub specialist mode
/goalkit.persona milestone       # Switch to milestone planning mode
/goalkit.persona strategy        # Switch to strategy exploration mode
/goalkit.persona qa             # Switch to quality assurance mode
/goalkit.persona documentation   # Switch to documentation mode
/goalkit.persona general         # Return to general mode (default)
```

When you switch to a specific persona, the agent will:
- Apply specialized knowledge and best practices for that role
- Focus on the specific responsibilities of that persona
- Use role-appropriate terminology and approaches
- Follow persona-specific guidelines and standards

### 9. Recommended Persona Workflows

The persona system works best when you switch to the most appropriate role for your current task:

**For Goal Creation**: Use the general agent or strategy explorer persona
**For Strategy Exploration**: Use the strategy explorer persona for deep technical analysis
**For Milestone Planning**: Use the milestone planner persona for measurable outcomes
**For Implementation**: Either stay as general agent or switch to specialized personas as needed
**For Code Review**: Switch to the QA specialist persona for quality focus
**For Repository Management**: Use the GitHub specialist persona for version control
**For Documentation**: Use the documentation specialist persona for clear docs

Personas help ensure you apply the right expertise at the right time while maintaining overall project consistency.

## üîß Goalkeeper CLI Reference

The `goalkeeper` command supports the following options:

## üéØ Goal Discovery for AI Agents

When using Goal Kit with AI coding agents, agents now follow a systematic approach to discover existing goals:

1. **Goal Discovery Process**: When processing commands that reference goals, AI agents will:
   - Use filesystem tools to search for goals in the `.goalkit/goals/` directory
   - Enumerate available goals when needed
   - Ask for clarification when goal references are ambiguous
   - Guide users to create new goals when none exist

2. **Enhanced Documentation**: For complete details on goal discovery mechanisms, see `templates/agent_goal_discovery.md`

3. **Improved User Experience**: This enhancement ensures AI agents can help users work with existing goals more effectively, even when the `.goalkit/` directory is git-ignored.
