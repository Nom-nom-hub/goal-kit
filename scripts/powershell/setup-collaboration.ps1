**Branch**: `$CollabDirName`$
**Created**: $(Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ")
**Mode**: [Single-Agent/Multi-Agent/Self-Coordination]
**Status**: Draft

## ü§ù Collaboration Overview

**Coordination Statement**: $CollabDescription

**Context**: [Why is this coordination important? What coordination challenge does it solve?]

**Participants**: [List of agents, systems, or processes involved in coordination - use "Self" for single-agent coordination]

**Success Level**: [What "successful coordination" looks like for this collaboration]

## üéØ Coordination Mode

- **Conflict Detection**: Identifying potential conflicts between agent work
- **Task Synchronization**: Coordinating work between agents to avoid conflicts
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Agents can access information created by other agents

### Self-Coordination Mode Features
- **State Consistency**: Ensuring the agent maintains consistency with its own previous work
- **Self-Verification**: Checking if previous decisions are still valid
- **Progress Tracking**: Maintaining awareness of own progress over time
