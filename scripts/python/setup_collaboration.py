**Branch**: `{collab_dir_name}`
**Created**: {datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ')}
**Mode**: [Single-Agent/Multi-Agent/Self-Coordination]
**Status**: Draft

## ü§ù Collaboration Overview

**Coordination Statement**: {collaboration_description}

**Context**: [Why is this coordination important? What coordination challenge does it solve?]

**Participants**: [List of agents, systems, or processes involved in coordination - use \"Self\" for single-agent coordination]

**Success Level**: [What \"successful coordination\" looks like for this collaboration]

## üéØ Coordination Mode

### Selected Mode: [Single-Agent Mode | Multi-Agent Mode | Self-Coordination Mode]

**Mode Justification**: [Why this coordination mode was selected - detected agents, user input, or default behavior]

### Single-Agent Mode Features
- **Self-Consistency**: Maintaining consistency across different interactions with the same agent
- **State Tracking**: Tracking decision state across different sessions
- **Progress Validation**: Validating previous decisions remain valid

### Multi-Agent Mode Features (If Applicable)
- **Agent Awareness**: Agents aware of work done by other agents
- **Conflict Detection**: Identifying potential conflicts between agent work
- **Task Synchronization**: Coordinating work between agents to avoid conflicts
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Agents can access information created by other agents

### Self-Coordination Mode Features
- **State Consistency**: Ensuring the agent maintains consistency with its own previous work
- **Self-Verification**: Checking if previous decisions are still valid
- **Progress Tracking**: Maintaining awareness of own progress over time
