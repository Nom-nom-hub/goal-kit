## ðŸŽ¯ Action Format Guidelines

### Action ID Format: `ACT###`
- **ACT001-ACT099**: Setup and foundational actions
- **ACT100-ACT199**: User Story 1 implementation actions
- **ACT200-ACT299**: User Story 2 implementation actions
- **ACT300-ACT399**: User Story 3 implementation actions
- **ACT900-ACT999**: Polish and cross-cutting actions

### Action Descriptions Should Be:
- **Specific**: Clear about what exactly needs to be done
- **Actionable**: Obvious how to complete the action
- **Bounded**: Reasonable scope for individual completion
- **Verifiable**: Clear criteria for when action is complete

### Parallel Execution Markers: `[P]`
- **No [P]**: Sequential dependency on previous action
- **[P]**: Can execute in parallel with other [P] actions
- **Same Group**: Actions in same group can often run in parallel
- **Different Groups**: Different groups may have dependencies

## ðŸ“Š Action Dependencies & Execution Order

### Milestone Dependencies
- **Action Group 1**: Foundation for all other groups
- **Action Group 2**: Can start after Group 1 core actions complete
- **Action Group 3**: Can start after Group 2 core actions complete

### Within Each Action Group
- **Core Actions**: Implement the primary functionality
- **Integration Actions**: Connect with other components
- **Validation Actions**: Test and verify the implementation
- **Documentation Actions**: Capture learning and usage

### Parallel Opportunities
- **Within Group**: Actions marked [P] can run in parallel
- **Across Groups**: Different groups can work simultaneously if no dependencies
- **Test Actions**: Validation actions often run in parallel
- **Documentation**: Learning capture can happen throughout

## ðŸ”„ Action Execution Strategy

### Individual Action Approach
1. **Read Action**: Understand exactly what needs to be done
2. **Plan Implementation**: Determine how to accomplish the action
3. **Execute Work**: Implement the required changes
4. **Verify Completion**: Confirm action meets its criteria
5. **Document Learning**: Capture insights and outcomes

### Group Execution Approach
1. **Start Parallel Actions**: Launch all [P] actions in group simultaneously
2. **Monitor Progress**: Track completion of independent actions
3. **Handle Dependencies**: Execute sequential actions as prerequisites complete
4. **Validate Group**: Ensure all actions in group complete successfully
5. **Test Integration**: Verify group works with other groups

### Cross-Group Coordination
1. **Foundation First**: Complete Action Group 1 before starting other groups
2. **Parallel Development**: Multiple groups can develop simultaneously
3. **Integration Points**: Identify where groups need to work together
4. **Validation Across Groups**: Test interactions between groups

## ðŸ“ˆ Progress Tracking

### Daily Action Checkpoints
- **Planned**: Actions scheduled for today
- **In Progress**: Actions currently being worked on
- **Completed**: Actions finished today
- **Blocked**: Actions that cannot proceed (document why)

### Action Health Indicators
- **On Track**: Making expected progress toward completion
- **At Risk**: May not complete as planned (identify issues)
- **Blocked**: Cannot proceed (document blockers and solutions)
- **Complete**: Successfully finished and validated

### Learning Capture at Action Level
- **Technical Insights**: What was learned about implementation
- **Process Improvements**: Better ways to approach similar actions
- **Risk Mitigation**: Issues discovered and how they were resolved
- **Success Patterns**: What worked well and why

## ðŸš¨ Risk Management at Action Level

### Common Action Risks
- **Technical Complexity**: Implementation approach not working as expected
- **Integration Issues**: Conflicts with existing code or other actions
- **Time Estimation**: Action taking longer than anticipated
- **Quality Concerns**: Implementation not meeting standards

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
- **Early Validation**: Test assumptions before full implementation
- **Incremental Progress**: Break complex actions into smaller steps
- **Alternative Approaches**: Have backup plans for critical actions
- **Frequent Check-ins**: Regular review of action progress

## âœ… Action Completion Criteria

### For Individual Actions
- [ ] Implementation meets action requirements
- [ ] Code/tests follow project standards
- [ ] No obvious bugs or issues
- [ ] Learning and insights documented
- [ ] Ready for integration with other actions

### For Action Groups
- [ ] All actions in group completed successfully
- [ ] Group functionality tested and working
- [ ] Integration with other groups verified
- [ ] Group learning synthesized and documented
- [ ] Ready for milestone validation

## ðŸ“š Knowledge Integration

### Technical Learning by Action
- **ACT001-ACT099**: Project setup and configuration patterns
- **ACT100-ACT199**: User Story 1 implementation approaches
- **ACT200-ACT299**: User Story 2 implementation approaches
- **ACT300-ACT399**: User Story 3 implementation approaches
- **ACT900-ACT999**: Polish and optimization techniques

### Process Learning by Action
- **Estimation Accuracy**: How well did time estimates match reality
- **Dependency Management**: How well were action dependencies handled
- **Quality Assurance**: Effectiveness of validation approaches
- **Communication**: How well was progress communicated

### Reusable Patterns
- **Successful Approaches**: Patterns to reuse in future goals
- **Anti-Patterns**: Approaches to avoid in future work
- **Optimization Opportunities**: Ways to improve similar actions
- **Tool Effectiveness**: Which tools and methods worked best
