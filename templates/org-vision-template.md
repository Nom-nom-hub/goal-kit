## 🧭 Guiding Principles

*How do we approach work? What are our operating norms?*

### Principle 1: [Name]
[Description and why it matters]

**Example**: **Goal-Driven Over Task-Driven**  
We define success by outcomes, not task completion. This ensures we're solving real problems and adapting based on evidence rather than following a fixed spec.

### Principle 2: [Name]
[Description and why it matters]

**Example**: **Async-First, Synchronous Where Necessary**  
We default to async communication and written decisions to respect deep work, enable distributed teams, and create searchable records. We use sync time strategically for decisions that truly require real-time discussion.

### Principle 3: [Name]
[Description and why it matters]

**Example**: **Learning Integration**  
We treat execution as hypothesis testing. Every goal produces learnings that inform future work. We capture, categorize, and systematically share these learnings.

### Principle 4: [Name]
[Description and why it matters]

**Example**: **Measurement and Transparency**  
We make decisions based on data, not intuition. All metrics and goals are visible to the organization. This builds trust and enables better decision-making.

### Principle 5: [Name]
[Description and why it matters]

**Example**: **Ownership and Accountability**  
Each goal has a clear owner. Each owner has autonomy to achieve their goal. We measure results, not effort.

## 🎓 What Goal Kit Goals Achieve

*How does our goal methodology serve the vision?*

Our organization uses Goal-Driven Development methodology to:

1. **Clarify priorities** - All goals ladder up to strategic pillars
2. **Enable adaptation** - Goals define success metrics, not implementation
3. **Drive learning** - Every goal produces learnings for next iteration
4. **Improve predictability** - Goals include risk assessment and dependency management
5. **Enable autonomy** - Owners choose implementation strategy; we measure outcomes
6. **Build capability** - Goals develop team skills systematically
7. **Celebrate progress** - Completed goals are reviewed and celebrated

## 🔄 How Goals Ladder Up to Vision

*Process for connecting individual goals to organizational vision*

1. **Strategic Pillar Alignment** - Each goal must connect to one of our strategic pillars
2. **Objective Contribution** - Goal success criteria should advance at least one 3-year objective
3. **Values Consistency** - Goal approach must reflect our core values
4. **Principle Adherence** - Goal must follow our guiding principles
5. **Metrics Alignment** - Goal metrics should feed organization-level success metrics where relevant

**See**: `templates/goal-alignment-template.md` for the goal-level alignment document.
