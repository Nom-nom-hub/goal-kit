# Context Templates

This directory contains context implementation examples extracted from completed goals in the Goal Kit system. These serve as templates and reference examples for implementing context-related functionality in new projects, especially AI context retention across chat sessions.

## About These Templates

These context implementation documents were originally created as part of goal `001-ai-context-retention` and demonstrate:

- How to structure context implementation documentation
- Best practices for capturing technical details related to context
- Approaches to performance optimization for context systems
- Testing strategies for context-related functionality
- Context management and retention techniques
- How AI agents can maintain project context across different chat sessions

## Available Templates

- `context-capture.md` - Examples of how to capture and store context effectively
- `context-retrieval.md` - Approaches to retrieving stored context
- `context-retrieval-implementation.md` - Detailed implementation of context retrieval functionality
- `context-retention-system.md` - System for AI agents to maintain context across chat sessions
- `performance-optimization.md` - Strategies for optimizing performance in context implementations
- `testing-context-functionality.md` - Testing approaches for context-related features

## Using These Templates

When implementing context-related features in new goals or setting up AI agents for context retention:
1. Review the relevant templates for approaches that might apply to your implementation
2. For AI agents: Use `context-retention-system.md` as a guide to implement context retention across chat sessions
3. Adapt the patterns to your specific requirements
4. Modify the documentation to reflect your actual implementation
5. Add your own details and considerations as needed

These templates are meant to accelerate context-related implementation by providing proven approaches and documentation patterns, particularly for enabling AI agents to maintain project awareness across multiple chat sessions.
