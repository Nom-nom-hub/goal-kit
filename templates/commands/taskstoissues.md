## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

1. Run `{SCRIPT}` from repo root and parse GOAL_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").
1. From the executed script, extract the path to **tasks** (from execution phase).
1. Get the Git remote by running:

```bash
git config --get remote.origin.url
```

**ONLY PROCEED TO NEXT STEPS IF THE REMOTE IS A GITHUB URL**

1. For each task in the list, use the GitHub MCP server to create a new issue in the repository that is representative of the Git remote.

**UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES EVER CREATE ISSUES IN REPOSITORIES THAT DO NOT MATCH THE REMOTE URL**
