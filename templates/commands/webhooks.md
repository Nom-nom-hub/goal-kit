# Webhooks Command Guide

## Purpose

Use `/goalkit.webhooks` commands to set up automated event notifications and integrations when important project events occur (tasks completed, goals achieved, deadlines approaching, risks detected).

Enable integration with external systems (Slack, Discord, GitHub, Jira, email, custom APIs) for real-time notifications.

## When to Use

| Situation | Action | Frequency |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| 🔔 Want Slack notifications on task completion | `webhooks add` | Once per project |
| 📱 Notify team of deadline approaching | `webhooks add` | Once per project |
| ⚠️ Alert on high-risk detection | `webhooks add` | Once per project |
| 🧪 Test webhook configuration | `webhooks test` | Before going live |
| 📋 Check registered webhooks | `webhooks list` | Weekly |
| 🗑️ Remove old/broken webhooks | `webhooks remove` | As needed |
| 📊 Review webhook delivery history | `webhooks events` | Troubleshooting |

## Command Reference

---

### `/goalkit.webhooks add [URL] [--events EVENT1,EVENT2] [--secret SECRET]`

**Purpose**: Register a new webhook URL to receive event notifications

**When to use**:
- Setting up Slack/Discord/email notifications
- Integrating with external project management tools
- Creating custom automation workflows
- First-time webhook setup

**Supported Events**:
- `task_completed` - When a task is marked done
- `goal_completed` - When a goal reaches 100% completion
- `deadline_approaching` - When goal deadline is within 7 days
- `high_risk` - When analytics detect at-risk status

**Outputs**:
```
Webhook Registered Successfully ✅
═════════════════════════════════

Webhook ID: wh_abc123def456
URL: https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXX
Events: task_completed, goal_completed
Status: ✅ ACTIVE
Secret: [auto-generated, stored securely]
First Delivery: [pending next event]

Header Verification:
├─ Algorithm: HMAC-SHA256
├─ Header: X-Goalkit-Signature
└─ Format: sha256=<hex_encoded_hash>

Next Steps:
1. Update your webhook consumer to verify signature
2. Test with `/goalkit.webhooks test <webhook_id>`
3. Monitor webhook events: `/goalkit.webhooks events`
```

**Example - Slack Integration**:
```bash
/goalkit.webhooks add https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXX \
  --events task_completed,goal_completed,deadline_approaching

# Expected: Webhook registered and ready
```

**Example - Custom API**:
```bash
/goalkit.webhooks add https://api.mycompany.com/goalkit/webhooks \
  --events goal_completed,high_risk \
  --secret my-custom-secret-key-12345

# Expected: Webhook with custom secret registered
```

**Security Notes**:
- Each webhook gets unique HMAC-SHA256 signing
- Include X-Goalkit-Signature header verification
- Secrets auto-generated and stored securely
- Never expose webhook URLs in logs/version control

---

### `/goalkit.webhooks remove [WEBHOOK_ID]`

**Purpose**: Unregister a webhook and stop sending events

**When to use**:
- Removing broken integrations
- Disabling old notifications
- Cleaning up unused webhooks
- Testing before removing (disable first)

**Outputs**:
```
Webhook Removed ✅
═════════════════

Webhook ID: wh_abc123def456
URL: https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXX
Status: DELETED

Notes:
- Cannot be undone, must re-add if needed
- Existing events not affected
- Future events will not be sent
```

**Example**:
```bash
/goalkit.webhooks remove wh_abc123def456

# Expected: Webhook deleted confirmation
```

**Caution**: Use `disable` if you want to temporarily stop events (can re-enable later)

---

### `/goalkit.webhooks test [WEBHOOK_ID]`

**Purpose**: Send a test event to validate webhook configuration

**When to use**:
- After adding new webhook
- After fixing webhook consumer
- Before going live with automation
- Troubleshooting delivery issues

**Outputs**:
```
Webhook Test Event Sent ✅
══════════════════════════

Webhook ID: wh_abc123def456
Event Type: task_completed (test)
Timestamp: 2025-01-15 14:32:45 UTC
Signed: Yes (X-Goalkit-Signature header included)

Response:
├─ Status: 200 OK ✅

```

**Example**:
```bash
/goalkit.webhooks test wh_abc123def456

# Expected: Test event sent and response validated
```

**Troubleshooting**:
- 404 Not Found → Check webhook URL is correct
- 401 Unauthorized → Check authentication/secret
- Timeout → Webhook consumer is too slow
- Connection refused → Consumer endpoint is down

---

### `/goalkit.webhooks enable [WEBHOOK_ID]`

**Purpose**: Re-enable a previously disabled webhook

**When to use**:
- After fixing a broken webhook consumer

## Common Workflows

### Setup Complete Notifications

```bash
# Register for goal completion
/goalkit.webhooks add https://hooks.slack.com/services/... \
  --events goal_completed

# Test
/goalkit.webhooks test wh_abc123

# Wait for goal completion, Slack message appears automatically
```

### Risk Alert Automation

```bash
# Register for high-risk detection
/goalkit.webhooks add https://api.company.com/escalate \
  --events high_risk

# When analytics detect risk, webhook fires immediately
# Your system can escalate, notify manager, trigger intervention
```

### Deadline Reminder System

```bash
# Register for deadline approaching
/goalkit.webhooks add https://calendar.company.com/api/reminders \
  --events deadline_approaching

# 7 days before deadline, webhook fires
# Your system can send team notifications
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Webhook Disabled After 10 Failures

**Problem**: Webhook auto-disabled due to repeated failures

**Solution**:
```bash
# 1. Check what's failing
/goalkit.webhooks events --webhook wh_abc123

# 2. Fix the issue (URL, authentication, endpoint down, etc.)

# 3. Re-enable
/goalkit.webhooks enable wh_abc123

# 4. Test
/goalkit.webhooks test wh_abc123
```

### Events Not Being Delivered

**Problem**: Registered webhook but not receiving events

**Solution**:
```bash
# 1. Verify webhook is active
/goalkit.webhooks list

# 2. Check event history
/goalkit.webhooks events --webhook wh_abc123

# 3. Send test event
/goalkit.webhooks test wh_abc123

# 4. If test works but real events don't:
#    - Verify event type is registered (webhooks types)
#    - Check if event has occurred yet
#    - Monitor with: /goalkit.webhooks events --limit 100
```

### Signature Verification Failing

**Problem**: X-Goalkit-Signature doesn't match

**Solution**:
```python
# Correct verification:
import hmac
import hashlib

def verify_signature(request_body, signature_header):
    # 1. Get raw request body as bytes
    body_bytes = request_body.encode('utf-8') if isinstance(request_body, str) else request_body
    
    # 2. Calculate expected signature
    expected = 'sha256=' + hmac.new(
        secret.encode('utf-8'),
        body_bytes,
        hashlib.sha256
    ).hexdigest()
    
    # 3. Compare
    return signature_header == expected
```
