```

## Output

The command generates:
- Updated strategy documents reflecting adaptations
- Revised milestone plans based on new approach
- Updated success criteria and measurement frameworks
- Documentation of adaptation rationale and expected outcomes

## Key Differences from Other Commands

| Command | Focus | Output |
|---------|-------|--------|
| **`/goalkit.strategies`** | Strategy planning | Multiple approach options |
| **`/goalkit.execute`** | Strategy implementation | Execution with measurement |
| **`/goalkit.adapt`** | Strategy adjustment | Revised plans based on learning |

## Integration with Other Commands

### Before Using `/goalkit.adapt`
- **`/goalkit.measure`**: Should provide data on what needs adaptation
- **`/goalkit.execute`**: Should generate learning that informs adaptation

### After Using `/goalkit.adapt`
- **`/goalkit.milestones`**: Update milestones to reflect adapted strategy
- **`/goalkit.execute`**: Resume execution with adapted approach
- **`/goalkit.goal`**: Update goal definition if learning warrants

## Best Practices

### Adaptation Decision-Making
- **Evidence-Based**: Use data and learning to justify changes
- **Stakeholder Involvement**: Include key stakeholders in adaptation decisions
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate risks of adaptation vs continuing current path
- **Transition Planning**: Plan how to implement the adaptation

### Change Management
- **Clear Rationale**: Document why adaptation is necessary
- **Impact Assessment**: Understand consequences of the change
- **Communication Strategy**: How to inform affected parties
- **Rollback Plan**: How to revert if adaptation doesn't work

### Learning Integration
- **Pattern Documentation**: Record what led to the need for adaptation
- **Prevention Strategies**: How to avoid similar issues in future
- **Success Patterns**: Document what works well for future reference
- **Process Improvement**: Update development processes based on learning

## Common Adaptation Scenarios

### Strategy Pivot Situations
- **Technical Approach Failure**: Chosen technology doesn't meet requirements
- **User Experience Issues**: Users struggle with current approach
- **Market Changes**: External factors require different strategy
- **Resource Constraints**: Need to adjust for available resources

### Timeline Adaptations
- **Slower Progress**: Current approach taking longer than expected
- **Faster Learning**: Can achieve goals sooner than planned
- **External Dependencies**: Delays from external factors or partners
- **Scope Changes**: Need to adjust for new requirements or constraints

### Scope Modifications
- **Over-ambitious Goals**: Need to reduce scope to achievable level
- **New Opportunities**: Can expand scope based on positive results
- **User Feedback**: Need to change direction based on user input
- **Business Priority Shifts**: Strategic direction changes require adaptation

## Adaptation Process Framework

### 1. Assessment Phase
- **Data Review**: Analyze measurement data and progress indicators
- **Learning Summary**: Document what has been discovered
- **Gap Analysis**: Identify differences between expected and actual results
- **Root Cause Identification**: Understand why current approach isn't working

### 2. Option Generation Phase
- **Alternative Identification**: Brainstorm different approaches
- **Feasibility Assessment**: Evaluate practicality of alternatives
- **Risk-Benefit Analysis**: Compare pros and cons of each option
- **Stakeholder Input**: Gather input from affected parties

### 3. Decision Phase
- **Criteria Definition**: Establish decision-making criteria
- **Option Evaluation**: Systematically compare alternatives
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate risks of change vs status quo
- **Decision Documentation**: Record rationale and expected outcomes

### 4. Implementation Phase
- **Transition Planning**: How to move to new approach
- **Communication**: Inform stakeholders of changes
- **Progress Monitoring**: Track adaptation implementation
- **Adjustment Readiness**: Be ready to fine-tune the adaptation

## Risk Management During Adaptation

### Transition Risks
- **Implementation Disruption**: Risk of breaking existing functionality
- **Team Resistance**: Pushback against changing direction
- **Stakeholder Concerns**: Worry about impact of changes
- **Timeline Impact**: Potential delays during transition

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Gradual Transition**: Implement changes incrementally when possible
- **Parallel Testing**: Test new approach alongside current one
- **Rollback Preparation**: Have clear plan to revert if needed
- **Communication Management**: Keep stakeholders informed throughout

## Success Measurement for Adaptations

### Adaptation Success Indicators
- **Improved Metrics**: Better progress toward goal outcomes
- **Reduced Risks**: Lower risk profile than previous approach
- **Team Buy-in**: Team support for the new direction
- **Learning Application**: Evidence that learning was applied effectively

### Validation Process
- **Short-term Validation**: Quick checks that adaptation is working
- **Medium-term Assessment**: Evaluation after initial implementation period
- **Long-term Success**: Final determination of adaptation effectiveness
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Ongoing assessment of adapted approach

## Examples

### Example 1: Technical Strategy Pivot
```
/goalkit.adapt User data shows 60% mobile usage but current web-first strategy only reaches 20% mobile users effectively. Pivot to mobile-first approach with responsive design patterns. Update milestones to prioritize mobile experience and adjust success metrics for mobile user engagement.
```

### Example 2: Timeline Adaptation
```
/goalkit.adapt Development velocity data shows current milestone pace is 40% slower than planned. User feedback validates the approach but indicates more iteration needed. Extend timeline by 25%, adjust resource allocation, and maintain quality focus over speed.
```

### Example 3: Scope Adjustment
```
/goalkit.adapt Early user testing reveals that the proposed feature scope is overwhelming to users. Measurement shows 80% drop-off in the current user flow. Reduce scope to core functionality only, focus on user experience quality, and plan iterative expansion based on user feedback.
