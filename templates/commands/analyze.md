- **`/goalkit.adapt`**: Apply recommendations to improve strategies
- **`/goalkit.plan`**: Create detailed plans based on analysis findings

## Best Practices

### Analysis Timing
- **Regular Reviews**: Monthly analysis for consistent monitoring
- **Milestone Reviews**: After each major milestone completion
- **Problem Reviews**: When issues arise or progress stalls
- **Planning Reviews**: Before strategic decisions

### Data-Driven Decisions
- **Evidence-Based**: All recommendations supported by project data
- **Trend-Focused**: Consider long-term patterns, not just current state
- **Context-Aware**: Account for project type and team dynamics
- **Actionable**: Every insight should lead to specific actions

### Continuous Improvement
- **Track Recommendations**: Monitor implementation of suggested changes
- **Measure Impact**: Assess whether analysis leads to better outcomes
- **Refine Process**: Improve analysis quality based on results
- **Share Learning**: Document insights for future projects

## Common Analysis Patterns

### Project Health Indicators
- **Green Zone**: All milestones on track, steady progress
- **Yellow Zone**: Some delays, needs attention
- **Red Zone**: Significant issues, requires immediate action

### Success Pattern Recognition
- **Fast-Track Goals**: Quickly completed, identify common factors
- **Stalled Goals**: Long-delayed, understand blocking issues
- **High-Impact Goals**: Disproportionate value contribution
- **Learning Goals**: Knowledge gained vs. time invested

## Examples

### Example 1: Monthly Project Review
```
/goalkit.analyze Provide monthly project health assessment. Focus on goal completion rates, milestone velocity, and team capacity utilization. Identify any patterns in successful vs. struggling goals.
```

### Example 2: Performance Issue Analysis
```
/goalkit.analyze Our milestone completion rate has dropped 40% this month. Analyze what changed, identify root causes, and recommend specific fixes to get back on track.
```

### Example 3: Strategic Planning Analysis
```
/goalkit.analyze We're planning Q4 goals. Analyze our historical performance patterns to identify which types of goals we execute well, which need more time, and what resources different goal types typically require.
```
