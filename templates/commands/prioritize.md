## Common Prioritization Patterns

### Priority Categories
- **P0 - Critical**: Must-do, blocking other work, high business impact
- **P1 - High**: Significant value, aligned with key objectives
- **P2 - Medium**: Valuable but not urgent, good ROI
- **P3 - Low**: Nice-to-have, low urgency, uncertain value

### Impact-Effort Matrix
- **Quick Wins**: High impact, low effort - do first
- **Major Projects**: High impact, high effort - plan carefully
- **Fill-Ins**: Low impact, low effort - do when time available
- **Thankless Tasks**: Low impact, high effort - avoid or delegate

### Strategic Considerations
- **Foundation Goals**: Enable other goals, create capabilities
- **Differentiating Goals**: Create competitive advantage
- **Risk Mitigation Goals**: Address threats or compliance requirements
- **Learning Goals**: Build knowledge and capabilities

## Examples

### Example 1: Portfolio Prioritization
