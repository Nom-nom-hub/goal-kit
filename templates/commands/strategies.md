## Quick Prerequisites Check

**BEFORE EXPLORING STRATEGIES**:
1. **Goal exists**: Check `goals/` directory for goal files
2. **Goal is well-defined**: Verify goal has clear success metrics

**If missing**: Tell user to use `/goalkit.goal` first.

## Quick Strategy Exploration Steps

**STEP 1**: Identify the goal to explore strategies for (most recent or specified)

**STEP 2**: Brainstorm 3-4 different approaches to achieve the goal:
- **Approach A**: [Conservative, proven method]
- **Approach B**: [Innovative, higher risk/higher reward]
- **Approach C**: [Balanced, middle-ground approach]
- **Approach D**: [Alternative perspective or methodology]

**STEP 3**: Compare approaches across key dimensions:
- **Feasibility**: How realistic is implementation?
- **Effort**: How much work is required?
- **Risk**: What could go wrong?
- **Learning Potential**: What insights could be gained?

**STEP 4**: Recommend starting strategy with clear rationale

**STEP 5**: Define validation experiments for key assumptions

**STEP 6**: Create `strategies.md` in the goal directory

**STEP 7**: Report completion and remind user of next steps:
- `/goalkit.milestones` - Create measurable progress checkpoints
- `/goalkit.execute` - Implement with learning and adaptation

**üõë STOP HERE** - Do NOT proceed to milestones or implementation automatically
**üõë STOP HERE** - Wait for user to explicitly run `/goalkit.milestones`

## Critical Strategy Rules

‚úÖ **DO**: Explore multiple valid approaches (3-4 options minimum)
‚úÖ **DO**: Evaluate feasibility, effort, risk, and learning potential
‚úÖ **DO**: Frame strategies as testable hypotheses
‚úÖ **DO**: Recommend starting point with clear rationale
‚ùå **DON'T**: Focus on just one "correct" solution
‚ùå **DON'T**: Include implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
‚ùå **DON'T**: Skip validation experiments for key assumptions

## Key Reminders

- **Multiple approaches** ‚Üí Always explore 3+ strategies
- **Testable hypotheses** ‚Üí Each strategy should be validatable
- **Learning focus** ‚Üí Strategies should enable insights
- **Always** end with reminder to use `/goalkit.milestones` next
