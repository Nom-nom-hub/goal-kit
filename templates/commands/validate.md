## Integration with Other Commands

### Before Using `/goalkit.validate`
- **Goal Creation**: Validate new goals before strategy development
- **Milestone Definition**: Ensure milestones are well-structured

### After Using `/goalkit.validate`
- **`/goalkit.adapt`**: Apply validation findings to improve goals
- **`/goalkit.strategies`**: Use insights to inform strategy selection
- **`/goalkit.plan`**: Create better plans based on validation feedback

## Best Practices

### Validation Timing
- **Pre-Strategy**: Validate goals before investing in strategy development
- **Post-Milestone**: Review milestone definitions for quality
- **Regular Reviews**: Monthly validation of active goals
- **Pre-Execution**: Final validation before implementation begins

### Quality Standards
- **Outcome Focus**: All elements should emphasize outcomes over implementation
- **Measurable Success**: Every goal must have quantifiable success criteria
- **Risk Awareness**: Potential issues should be identified and addressed
- **Learning Orientation**: Goals should support hypothesis testing and adaptation

### Actionable Feedback
- **Specific Issues**: Clearly identify what's wrong and why
- **Concrete Solutions**: Provide specific fixes, not general advice
- **Priority Levels**: Distinguish critical issues from nice-to-have improvements
- **Implementation Guidance**: Clear steps for applying recommendations

## Common Validation Issues

### Critical Issues (Must Fix)
- **Unmeasurable Success Criteria**: Goals without quantifiable outcomes
- **Implementation Focus**: Describing how rather than what to achieve
- **Missing Milestones**: No clear progress indicators
- **Undefined Stakeholders**: Unclear who benefits and how

### Important Issues (Should Fix)
- **Vague Language**: Unclear or ambiguous goal statements
- **Unrealistic Timelines**: Schedules that don't account for complexity
- **Missing Risk Assessment**: No consideration of potential obstacles
- **Incomplete Metrics**: Success criteria without measurement methods

### Enhancement Opportunities (Could Improve)
- **Additional Metrics**: Extra success indicators for comprehensive measurement
- **Strategy Options**: More implementation approaches to consider
- **Learning Objectives**: Explicit hypothesis testing opportunities
- **Stakeholder Details**: More specific user and stakeholder definitions

## Examples

### Example 1: New Goal Validation
```
/goalkit.validate Review the mobile app performance goal. Check if success criteria are measurable, milestones are achievable, and risk factors are properly identified.
```

### Example 2: Milestone Quality Review
```
/goalkit.validate Assess the user onboarding milestones for clarity and measurability. Ensure each milestone has clear success indicators and validation methods.
```

### Example 3: Strategy Validation
```
/goalkit.validate Evaluate the proposed strategies for technical feasibility and alignment with goal success criteria. Identify any risks or implementation challenges.
```
