### Enables These Goals (What this unlocks)
<!-- AI GUIDANCE: Document what other goals or capabilities become possible once this goal is achieved. -->

- **[Enabled Goal 1]**: [How this goal creates foundation for other work]
  - **Specific Benefit**: [Concrete capability or outcome this enables]
  - **Timeline Impact**: [How this affects timing of dependent goals]
