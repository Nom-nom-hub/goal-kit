## ðŸ“ˆ Progress Tracking Framework

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define how to track progress across milestones.
-->

### Overall Progress Metrics
- **Goal Progress**: [How to measure overall progress toward the goal]
- **Milestone Velocity**: [How to track speed of milestone completion]
- **Learning Progress**: [How to measure insights and discoveries]

### Milestone Health Indicators
- **On Track**: [Indicators that milestone is progressing well]
- **At Risk**: [Warning signs that milestone needs attention]
- **Blocked**: [Indicators that milestone cannot proceed]

### Adaptation Triggers
- **Accelerate**: [When to speed up milestone execution]
- **Slow Down**: [When to take more time for learning]
- **Pivot**: [When to change milestone approach or sequence]

## ðŸ”„ Milestone Review Process

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define how to review milestone progress and adapt as needed.
-->

### Review Cadence
- **After Each Milestone**: [What to review and how]
- **Bi-weekly**: [Regular progress check]
- **Monthly**: [Strategic milestone alignment review]

### Review Framework
**For Each Completed Milestone**:
1. **Measure Results**: [Compare actual vs expected outcomes]
2. **Capture Learning**: [Document what was discovered]
3. **Assess Strategy**: [Evaluate if current approach is working]
4. **Plan Next Steps**: [Adjust subsequent milestones if needed]

**For In-Progress Milestones**:
1. **Progress Assessment**: [Current status vs plan]
2. **Risk Review**: [Identify new risks or issues]
3. **Resource Check**: [Ensure adequate support]
4. **Adjustment Planning**: [Plan any needed changes]

### Decision Framework
**Continue Current Path When**:
- [Indicators that current milestone approach is working]
- [Metrics showing expected progress]
- [Learning supporting current strategy]
