# Enhanced User Guidance System for Template Usage

**Guidance Version**: 2.0 | **Approach**: Progressive Disclosure with Contextual Help

## ðŸŽ¯ User Guidance Philosophy

This guidance system uses progressive disclosure to show users only what they need when they need it, reducing cognitive load while ensuring comprehensive support for template creation.

## ðŸ“š Progressive Disclosure Framework

### Phase 1: Essential Information (Show First)

**Core Template Structure**:
- **Goal Statement**: Single sentence describing desired outcome
- **Success Criteria**: 2-3 primary metrics with specific targets
- **Basic Milestones**: 3 high-level milestones with success indicators

**Initial Help Text**:
- **Goal Statement**: "Describe what you want to achieve, not how to achieve it. Format: 'Enable [user type] to [specific action] resulting in [measurable benefit]'"
- **Success Criteria**: "Define 2-3 specific, measurable outcomes that indicate success. Include numbers and timeframes."
- **Milestones**: "Break your goal into 3-5 major steps. Each should deliver clear value and be testable."

### Phase 2: Enhanced Structure (Show After Basics Complete)

**Expanded Template Sections**:
- **Stakeholder Analysis**: Identify who benefits and who needs to approve
- **Hypothesis Framework**: Document key assumptions to test
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify potential issues and mitigation strategies

**Contextual Help Text**:
- **Stakeholder Analysis**: "Think about who will use this, who will pay for it, and who can block it. Be specific about each group's needs."
- **Hypothesis Framework**: "What assumptions are you making that could be wrong? Frame them as 'If X, then Y' statements."
- **Risk Assessment**: "What could prevent success? Focus on risks that would completely derail the goal."

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Show On Demand)

**Advanced Template Elements**:
- **Dependency Mapping**: Detailed prerequisite and enablement relationships
- **Validation Framework**: Comprehensive measurement and learning strategies
- **Implementation Considerations**: Technical constraints and resource requirements

### Inline Help Text

**Field-Level Guidance**:
- **Goal Statement Field**: "Example: 'Enable small business owners to create professional invoices in under 5 minutes resulting in 50% faster payment collection'"
- **Success Criteria Field**: "Example: 'Reduce invoice creation time from 15 minutes to under 5 minutes within 3 months'"
- **Milestone Field**: "Example: 'Complete user research and validation (P1) - Validate that business owners actually need this solution'"

### Section-Level Help

**Section Overview Help**:
- **Success Criteria Section**: "This section defines what 'done' looks like. Good criteria are specific, measurable, and time-bound."
- **Milestone Section**: "Milestones break big goals into testable chunks. Each should validate key assumptions and deliver real value."
- **Stakeholder Section**: "Understanding your users and stakeholders prevents surprises later. Be specific about who benefits and why."
