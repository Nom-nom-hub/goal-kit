# Goal Definition: [GOAL NAME]

**Goal Branch**: `[###-goal-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Vision**: [Link to vision document]

## Goal Scenarios & Outcomes *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: Goal outcomes should be PRIORITIZED as measurable results ordered by importance.
  Each goal outcome must be INDEPENDENTLY MEASURABLE - meaning if you achieve just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable outcome that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each outcome, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each outcome as a standalone measurable result that can be:
  - Planned independently
  - Measured independently
  - Validated independently
  - Demonstrated to stakeholders independently
-->

### Goal Outcome 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this measurable outcome in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Measurement**: [Describe how this can be measured independently - e.g., "Can be fully measured by [specific metric] and delivers [specific value]"]

**Success Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [current state], **When** [goal achievement], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [current state], **When** [goal achievement], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### Goal Outcome 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)

[Describe this measurable outcome in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Measurement**: [Describe how this can be measured independently]

**Success Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [current state], **When** [goal achievement], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### Goal Outcome 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

[Describe this measurable outcome in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Measurement**: [Describe how this can be measured independently]

**Success Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [current state], **When** [goal achievement], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

[Add more goal outcomes as needed, each with an assigned priority]

## Success Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right success requirements.
-->

### Measurable Requirements

- **SR-001**: Outcome MUST achieve [specific measurable result, e.g., "80% user satisfaction score"]
- **SR-002**: Goal MUST deliver [specific measurable impact, e.g., "20% increase in user engagement"]  
- **SR-003**: Impact MUST be [specific measurable criterion, e.g., "sustainable over 6 months"]
- **SR-004**: Results MUST include [specific data point, e.g., "quantified user behavior changes"]
- **SR-005**: Success MUST be [specific validation, e.g., "confirmed by independent assessment"]

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*

- **SR-006**: Outcome MUST achieve [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: success metric not specified - satisfaction, engagement, retention?]
- **SR-007**: Impact MUST be sustained for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: time period not specified]

### Key Success Indicators *(include if goal involves measurable impact)*

- **[Indicator 1]**: [What it measures, key metrics without implementation details]
- **[Indicator 2]**: [What it measures, relationships to other outcomes]

## Goal Validation *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable validation approaches.
  These must be outcome-focused and measurable.
-->

### Validation Criteria

- **VC-001**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "Users achieve desired outcome within specified timeframe"]
- **VC-002**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "Business metric improves by specific percentage"]
- **VC-003**: [User impact metric, e.g., "90% of users confirm positive change"]
- **VC-004**: [Business impact metric, e.g., "Reduce negative outcomes by 50%"]

### Validation Methods

- **Direct Measurement**: [How to measure results directly]
- **User Feedback**: [How to validate with actual users]
- **Business Metrics**: [How to validate business impact]
- **Long-term Tracking**: [How to validate sustainability]

### UI/UX Requirements *(include if goal involves user interface)*

**Design Standards**:

- **Professional Appearance**: Interface must look polished and professionally designed
- **Visual Consistency**: Consistent typography, spacing, and design patterns throughout
- **Responsive Design**: Interface must work well on all screen sizes and devices
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards for color contrast and navigation
- **Performance**: Interface elements must load quickly and respond immediately to user input
- **Error Handling**: Clear, helpful error messages and recovery paths for all user interactions
- **User Testing**: Interface designs must be validated with real users before implementation

**Success Criteria for UI**:
