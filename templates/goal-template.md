# Goal Statement: [GOAL DESCRIPTION]

**Goal Branch**: `[###-goal-name]`
**Created**: [DATE]
**Status**: Draft
**Methodology**: Goal-Driven Development

## Beneficiary Scenarios & Validation *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as beneficiary journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY VALIDATABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.

  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Validated independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### Beneficiary Story 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this beneficiary journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Validation**: [Describe how this can be validated independently - e.g., "Can be fully validated by [specific action] and delivers [specific value]"]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### Beneficiary Story 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)

[Describe this beneficiary journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Validation**: [Describe how this can be validated independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### Beneficiary Story 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

[Describe this beneficiary journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Validation**: [Describe how this can be validated independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

[Add more beneficiary stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right edge cases.
-->

- What happens when [boundary condition]?
- How does system handle [error scenario]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System/Process MUST [specific capability, e.g., "allow users to achieve goal"]
- **FR-002**: System/Process MUST [specific capability, e.g., "validate success metrics"]
- **FR-003**: Stakeholders MUST be able to [key interaction, e.g., "measure goal progress"]
- **FR-004**: System/Process MUST [data requirement, e.g., "persist goal progress"]
- **FR-005**: System/Process MUST [behavior, e.g., "log all validation events"]

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*

- **FR-006**: System/Process MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific support method not specified - validation approach, measurement method, etc?]
- **FR-007**: System/Process MUST achieve [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: target level not specified - specific metrics not defined]

### Key Entities *(include if goal involves data)*

- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "Stakeholders can measure goal progress in under 2 minutes"]
- **SC-002**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "System handles 1000 measurement requests without degradation"]
- **SC-003**: [User satisfaction metric, e.g., "90% of stakeholders successfully validate primary goal on first attempt"]
- **SC-004**: [Business metric, e.g., "Reduce support tickets related to [X] by 50%"]
