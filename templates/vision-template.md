# Project Vision: [PROJECT NAME]

**Created**: [DATE]
**Status**: Active
**Focus**: Goal-Driven Development

## Core Mission *(mandatory)*

What is the fundamental purpose of this project? Why does it exist?

*Example: "Build a real-time collaboration platform that enables distributed teams to work together as effectively as colocated teams."*

## Vision Statement *(mandatory)*

Inspirational description of the desired future state.

*Example: "Teams everywhere can create, iterate, and ship without friction or delay, regardless of timezone or location."*

## Success Scenarios *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: Success scenarios should be PRIORITIZED as beneficiary journeys ordered by importance.
  Each success scenario/journey must be STANDALONE DELIVERABLE - meaning if you achieve just ONE of them,
  you should still have delivered meaningful value.

  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each scenario, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each scenario as independently plannable, measurable, and demonstrable.
-->

### Success Scenario 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

Describe this success scenario in plain language. What user journey does it enable?

*Example: "Engineering teams can collaborate in real-time on code reviews without context switching between tools."*

**Why this priority**: Explain the value and why it has this priority level.

*Example: "Code review is the highest-friction part of our development workflow, causing delays and context loss."*

**Standalone Delivery**: How this scenario can be achieved and measured independently.

*Example: "Can be fully achieved by implementing live code annotation + commenting features, delivering immediate value for review workflows while async feedback features can follow."*

**Key Metrics** *(2-3 measurable outcomes)*:

1. 80% of reviews completed within 2 hours (vs. current 8+ hours)
2. 90% of reviewers complete first review without reopening discussion threads

### Success Scenario 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)

Describe this success scenario in plain language.

**Why this priority**: Explain the value and why it has this priority level.

**Standalone Delivery**: How this scenario can be achieved independently.

**Key Metrics** *(2-3 measurable outcomes)*:

1. [Metric]
2. [Metric]

### Success Scenario 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

Describe this success scenario in plain language.

**Why this priority**: Explain the value and why it has this priority level.

**Standalone Delivery**: How this scenario can be achieved independently.

**Key Metrics** *(2-3 measurable outcomes)*:

1. [Metric]

## Guiding Principles *(mandatory)*

1. [Principle with concrete guidance on how to apply it]
   - Example: "Prioritize user feedback over assumptions - all new features require user validation before full implementation"
   
2. [Principle with concrete guidance on how to apply it]
3. [Principle with concrete guidance on how to apply it]

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- [Outcome with specific metric and target - e.g., "User retention rate of 75% month-over-month"]
- [Outcome with specific metric and target]
- [Outcome with specific metric and target]

### Aspirational Outcomes

- [Outcome that's valuable but harder to quantify]
- [Outcome that's valuable but harder to quantify]
