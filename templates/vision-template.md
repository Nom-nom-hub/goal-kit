# Project Vision: [PROJECT NAME]

**Created**: [DATE]
**Status**: Active
**Focus**: Goal-Driven Development

## Core Mission *(mandatory)*

[What is the fundamental purpose of this project?]

## Vision Statement *(mandatory)*

[Inspirational description of the desired future state]

## Success Scenarios *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: Success scenarios should be PRIORITIZED as beneficiary journeys ordered by importance.
  Each success scenario/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY ACHIEVABLE - meaning if you achieve just ONE of them,
  you should still have delivered meaningful value.

  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each scenario, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each scenario as a standalone achievement that can be:
  - Planned independently
  - Measured independently
  - Demonstrated independently
-->
