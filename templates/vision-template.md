# Project Vision: [PROJECT NAME]

**Created**: [DATE]
**Status**: Active
**Focus**: Goal-Driven Development

## üéØ Project Purpose

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define the fundamental purpose of this project.
  Focus on WHY this project exists and what broader impact it seeks to achieve.
-->

**Core Mission**: [What is the fundamental mission this project serves?]

**Vision Statement**: [Inspirational description of the future state this project aims to create]

**Target Outcomes**: [What specific outcomes should this project achieve?]

## üìä Success Metrics

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define how you'll measure project success.
  These should be outcome-focused, not implementation-focused.
-->

### Primary Success Indicators

- **User Outcome 1**: [Measurable user benefit] - Target: [specific metric]
- **User Outcome 2**: [Measurable user benefit] - Target: [specific metric]
- **Business Outcome 1**: [Measurable business impact] - Target: [specific metric]
- **Business Outcome 2**: [Measurable business impact] - Target: [specific metric]

### Secondary Success Indicators

- **Learning Goals**: [What you want to discover through this project]
- **Innovation Goals**: [New approaches or insights to develop]
- **Capability Goals**: [New skills or expertise to build]

## üß≠ Guiding Principles

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Establish the core principles that will guide all development decisions.
  These principles should focus on outcomes, learning, and adaptation.
-->

### Principle 1: Outcome-First Thinking
Every decision must prioritize user and business outcomes over implementation preferences or technical elegance.

### Principle 2: Measurable Progress
All work must contribute to measurable progress toward defined success metrics.

### Principle 3: Strategy Flexibility
Multiple valid approaches exist for achieving any goal. Remain open to different strategies based on learning and results.

### Principle 4: Learning Integration
Treat implementation as hypothesis testing. Every milestone should generate insights that inform future strategies.

### Principle 5: Adaptive Planning
Plans are hypotheses to be tested, not contracts to be executed. Be willing to change course based on evidence.

### Principle 6: Exploration Mindset
Embrace uncertainty as an opportunity for discovery. Multiple approaches should be explored before committing to a single path.

## üéØ Project Goals

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define the high-level goals for this project.
  Each goal should have clear success criteria and measurable outcomes.
-->

### Goal 1: [Goal Title]
**Description**: [What outcome this goal seeks to achieve]

**Success Criteria**:
- [Measurable outcome 1]
- [Measurable outcome 2]
- [Measurable outcome 3]

**Why Important**: [Why this goal matters to users and business]

### Goal 2: [Goal Title]
**Description**: [What outcome this goal seeks to achieve]

**Success Criteria**:
- [Measurable outcome 1]
- [Measurable outcome 2]
- [Measurable outcome 3]

**Why Important**: [Why this goal matters to users and business]

## üöÄ Project Scope

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define what is included and excluded from this project.
  Focus on outcomes rather than specific features or implementations.
-->

### What's Included
- [Outcome or capability that will be delivered]
- [User benefit that will be provided]
- [Business value that will be created]

### What's Explicitly Excluded
- [Outcomes or approaches that are out of scope]
- [User needs that won't be addressed]
- [Technical approaches that won't be considered]

## ‚è±Ô∏è Project Phases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define the high-level phases focused on learning and outcomes.
-->

### Phase 1: Foundation (Exploration & Learning)
- Establish baseline understanding
- Identify key assumptions to test
- Create initial measurement framework

### Phase 2: Validation (Hypothesis Testing)
- Test core assumptions with minimal implementations
- Measure actual vs expected outcomes
- Learn from early user and business feedback

### Phase 3: Optimization (Strategy Refinement)
- Optimize based on learning from Phase 2
- Explore alternative strategies where needed
- Scale successful approaches

### Phase 4: Expansion (Outcome Maximization)
- Expand to additional user segments or use cases
- Maximize outcomes based on proven strategies
- Document learning for future projects

## üìà Measurement & Learning Framework

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define how progress will be measured and learning captured.
-->

### Key Metrics to Track
- **Leading Indicators**: Early signals of progress toward goals
- **Lagging Indicators**: Final measures of goal achievement
- **Learning Metrics**: Indicators of insights and discoveries

### Learning Capture Process
- **Milestone Reviews**: Structured reflection at each milestone
- **Strategy Assessments**: Evaluation of different approaches
- **Pivot Decisions**: Framework for changing course when needed

### Knowledge Documentation
- **What Worked**: Approaches and strategies that succeeded
- **What Didn't Work**: Failed approaches and why
- **Key Insights**: Important discoveries for future projects

## üîÑ Review & Adaptation Process

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define how the project will adapt based on learning.
-->

### Regular Review Cadence
- **Weekly**: Progress toward current milestones
- **Bi-weekly**: Strategy effectiveness and needed adjustments
- **Monthly**: Goal relevance and overall project direction

### Decision Framework for Changes
- **Continue**: When metrics show progress toward goals
- **Pivot**: When strategies aren't producing expected outcomes
- **Pause**: When external factors require reassessment
- **Stop**: When goals are achieved or no longer relevant
