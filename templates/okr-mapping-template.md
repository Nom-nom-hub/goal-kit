# Goal to OKR Mapping

**Goal ID**: [###] | **Goal Name**: [Name] | **Quarter**: [Q1 2025]

## Which OKRs Does This Goal Support?

*Map this goal to specific Key Results. A goal typically contributes to 1-3 KRs, not more.*

### Mapping Summary

| Objective | Key Result | How This Goal Contributes | Impact % |
|-----------|------------|--------------------------|----------|
| [Obj #] | [KR description] | [How does execution advance this KR?] | [What % of KR progress does this goal represent?] |
| [Obj #] | [KR description] | [How does execution advance this KR?] | [What % of KR progress does this goal represent?] |

**Example**:
| Objective | Key Result | How This Goal Contributes | Impact % |
|-----------|------------|--------------------------|----------|
| Objective 1: Product Excellence | KR 1.1: Ship 5 major features | Building real-time collaboration feature (1 of 5 planned) | 20% |
| Objective 1: Product Excellence | KR 1.2: Achieve 4.5+ app store rating | Real-time collab is top customer request; shipping it drives adoption | 30% |

## Goal Success Criteria vs. OKR Key Results

*How do your goal success metrics prove you achieved the OKR?*

### Primary Goal Success Criterion Mapping

**Goal SC-001**: [Your goal success criterion]  
**Links to KR**: [Which OKR Key Result?]  
**How it proves the KR**:  
[Explain the causal connection. How does achieving this goal metric prove the KR is achieved?]

**Example**:
- **Goal SC-001**: Reduce code review latency from 5 hours to 2 hours average
- **Links to KR**: OKR 1.1 (Ship 5 features with >90% adoption)
- **How it proves the KR**: Faster reviews enable faster feature shipping → more features can launch per quarter

## Timeline Alignment

*Does your goal timeline allow you to contribute to this OKR's quarter?*

| Element | Timeline |
|---------|----------|
| **OKR Quarter** | [Q1 2025: Jan 1 - Mar 31] |
| **Goal Start Date** | [When does work begin?] |
| **Milestone Completion Dates** | [When are each milestone completed?] |
| **Goal Completion** | [When is goal fully achieved?] |
| **OKR Measurement Date** | [When is KR measured/validated?] |

**Assessment**: Will this goal's results be visible by the OKR measurement date?
- ✅ Yes, completed by [date]
- ⚠️ Partial, expected to contribute [X%] of KR by EOQ
- ❌ No, goal slips past OKR measurement window

## Impact Assessment

*What's the business value of this goal to the OKR?*

### If This Goal Succeeds
- **OKR Impact**: [Specifically, what about the OKR becomes more achievable?]
- **Customer Impact**: [Who benefits? How?]
- **Revenue Impact**: [$ impact or ARR contribution, if applicable]
- **Strategic Impact**: [How does this advance company strategy?]

### If This Goal Fails
- **OKR Risk**: [Which KRs become at-risk or impossible?]
- **Mitigation**: [Do you have backup goals to achieve this KR?]
- **Escalation**: [Should this be flagged to leadership as OKR risk?]

**Example**:
- **If Succeeds**: 30% of engineers can use new API contract → enables 50% more feature development velocity → KR 1.1 (ship 5 features) becomes achievable
- **If Fails**: Current API contract becomes bottleneck → feature shipping delays by 4 weeks → KR 1.1 at risk
- **Mitigation**: If goal fails, deprioritize 2 planned features to stay on target
- **Escalation**: Flag to VP Eng if goal at-risk by week 3

## Dependency Management

*What other goals must succeed for this goal to contribute to its OKRs?*

### Blocking Goals (must complete first)
| Goal | Why Blocking | Timeline Impact | Risk Level |
|------|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| [Goal ###] | [Why does it block?] | [When needed?] | High/Med/Low |

**Example**:
| Goal | Why Blocking | Timeline Impact | Risk Level |
|------|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| Goal 005: Migrate to Cloud | New API requires cloud infrastructure | Must complete by Week 2 | High |

### Dependent Goals (this goal unblocks them)
| Goal | What Unblocks | Timeline | Risk if Delayed |
|------|-------------|----------|-----------------|
| [Goal ###] | [What does it unlock?] | [When needed?] | High/Med/Low |

**Example**:
| Goal | What Unblocks | Timeline | Risk if Delayed |
|------|-------------|----------|-----------------|
| Goal 007: Mobile App Launch | Requires new API contract | Week 6 for mobile team to integrate | High |

*How confident are you this goal will achieve the OKR it supports?*

### Success Probability
- **Confidence Level**: [1-5 scale, where 5 = certain we'll hit our metrics and contribute to KR]
- **Why this confidence**: [Rationale]

### Major Risks to OKR Contribution
| Risk | Impact on OKR | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| [Risk] | [Which KR?] | High/Med/Low | [Plan] |
