## Core Methodology Commands
- **`/goalkit.vision`** - Establish project vision and principles
- **`/goalkit.goal`** - Define goals and success criteria  
- **`/goalkit.strategies`** - Explore implementation strategies
- **`/goalkit.milestones`** - Create measurable milestones
- **`/goalkit.execute`** - Execute with learning and adaptation

## Methodology Adherence Guidelines

### Must Follow the 5-Step Process
**ALWAYS follow this sequence for complex goals:**
1. `/goalkit.vision` - Establish vision and principles
2. `/goalkit.goal` - Define measurable goals with outcomes
3. `/goalkit.strategies` - Explore multiple approaches
4. `/goalkit.milestones` - Create measurable progress checkpoints
5. `/goalkit.execute` - Execute with learning and adaptation

### When to Use Each Command

#### Skip Full Process (Simple Tasks)
For simple tasks that don't require measurable outcomes, you may implement directly:
- Visual enhancements (e.g., "enhanced header", "better styling")
- Minor fixes (e.g., "fix button color", "add margin")
- Small improvements without measurable success criteria

#### Use Full Process (Complex Goals)
For complex goals with measurable success criteria, **ALWAYS** follow the complete 5-step methodology:
- New features with measurable outcomes (%,$,timeframes,user counts)
- System changes with defined success metrics
- User workflows requiring success measurements
- Any goal that impacts multiple parts of the system

### Critical Adherence Rules

#### For `/goalkit.goal`:
- All goals must have quantifiable success metrics with specific targets (%,$,timeframes,user counts)
- No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) allowed in goal definitions
- Focus on measurable user/business outcomes instead

#### For `/goalkit.strategies`:
- Explore multiple valid approaches (not just one "correct" solution)
- Each strategy must be testable with clear validation criteria
- Compare strategies across relevant dimensions (feasibility, effort, risk, learning potential)

#### For `/goalkit.milestones`:
- Create measurable progress checkpoints with specific success indicators
- Each milestone should validate learning and progress toward the goal
- Include clear value delivered at each milestone

#### For `/goalkit.execute`:
- Focus on learning and adaptation rather than rigid plan execution
- Implement with continuous measurement and validation
- Document insights and knowledge gained throughout execution

### Next Step Reminders
After completing each command, **ALWAYS** remind the user of the next required step:

- After `/goalkit.goal`: "Now use `/goalkit.strategies` to explore multiple approaches"
- After `/goalkit.strategies`: "Now use `/goalkit.milestones` to create measurable checkpoints"
- After `/goalkit.milestones`: "Now use `/goalkit.execute` to implement with learning loops"
