## üéØ Dependency Structure Overview

This dependency structure defines how goals relate to each other through prerequisite chains, enablement relationships, and hierarchical dependencies to ensure coherent goal portfolios and optimal execution sequencing.

## üìä Goal Hierarchy Framework

### 1. Goal Levels and Relationships
<!-- AI GUIDANCE: Define clear levels of goals and how they relate to each other. -->

**Vision Level** (Top-level strategic direction):
- **Purpose**: Define overall mission and strategic objectives
- **Scope**: 1-3 year horizon with broad organizational impact
- **Relationship**: All goals must align with and support vision

**Strategic Goals** (Major objectives supporting vision):
- **Purpose**: Break vision into major achievable outcomes
- **Scope**: 6-12 month horizon with significant business impact
- **Relationship**: Support vision, enable tactical goals

**Tactical Goals** (Implementation-focused objectives):
- **Purpose**: Execute specific strategies to achieve strategic goals
- **Scope**: 1-6 month horizon with focused, measurable outcomes
- **Relationship**: Support strategic goals, enable operational goals

**Operational Goals** (Day-to-day execution objectives):
- **Purpose**: Complete specific projects or improve ongoing operations
- **Scope**: 1-3 month horizon with immediate, practical impact
- **Relationship**: Support tactical goals, may be very specific

### 2. Dependency Types and Validation
<!-- AI GUIDANCE: Define different types of dependencies and validation rules. -->

**Hard Dependencies** (Must be completed first):
- **Definition**: Goal A must be completed before Goal B can start
- **Validation**: Clear deliverable from A required by B
- **Impact**: Delays in A directly delay B
- **Example**: "Complete user research before designing interface"

**Soft Dependencies** (Should be completed first):
- **Definition**: Goal A should be completed before Goal B for optimal results
- **Validation**: Beneficial but not strictly required relationship
- **Impact**: Suboptimal outcomes if reversed, but B can still proceed
- **Example**: "Define success metrics before implementing tracking"

**Enablement Dependencies** (Creates capability for others):
- **Definition**: Goal A creates capability or resource needed by Goal B
- **Validation**: Specific output from A becomes input for B
- **Impact**: A expands what B can achieve
- **Example**: "Build API platform enables integration features"

**Mutual Dependencies** (Goals support each other):
- **Definition**: Goal A and Goal B provide mutual benefits
- **Validation**: Each goal enhances the other's success
- **Impact**: Combined effect greater than individual contributions
- **Example**: "Content strategy and design system support each other"

## üìã Dependency Mapping Framework

### Dependency Identification Process
<!-- AI GUIDANCE: Systematic approach to identifying and documenting dependencies. -->

**Step 1: Goal Analysis**:
- **Input Requirements**: What does this goal need to start?
- **Output Production**: What does this goal produce when complete?
- **Capability Building**: What new abilities does this goal create?
- **Resource Consumption**: What resources does this goal require?

**Step 2: Cross-Goal Analysis**:
- **Input-Output Matching**: Find goals whose outputs match other goals' inputs
- **Capability Alignment**: Identify goals that create capabilities other goals need
- **Timeline Coordination**: Ensure dependent goals have compatible schedules
- **Resource Conflict Identification**: Find goals competing for same resources

**Step 3: Dependency Validation**:
- **Necessity Check**: Is dependency truly required or just beneficial?
- **Feasibility Assessment**: Can prerequisite goal realistically be completed first?
- **Impact Analysis**: What happens if dependency chain breaks?
- **Alternative Options**: Are there workarounds if dependency fails?

### Dependency Documentation Structure
<!-- AI GUIDANCE: Standard format for documenting goal dependencies. -->

**Dependency Record Format**:
- **Dependent Goal**: [Goal that has the dependency]
- **Prerequisite Goal**: [Goal that must be completed first]
- **Dependency Type**: [Hard/Soft/Enablement/Mutual]
- **Specific Requirement**: [Exact deliverable or capability needed]
- **Timeline Impact**: [How dependency affects scheduling]
- **Risk Assessment**: [Consequences if dependency not met]
- **Mitigation Options**: [Alternatives if dependency fails]

**Visualization Requirements**:
- **Dependency Graph**: Visual representation of goal relationships
- **Timeline Alignment**: Show how dependencies affect goal sequencing
- **Critical Path Identification**: Highlight most important dependency chains
- **Conflict Detection**: Identify incompatible or circular dependencies

## üéØ Subgoal Structure and Management

### Subgoal Definition Framework
<!-- AI GUIDANCE: How to break goals into manageable subgoals with clear relationships. -->

**Subgoal Creation Criteria**:
- **Size Management**: Each subgoal should be achievable in 1-3 months
- **Value Delivery**: Each subgoal should provide standalone value
- **Testability**: Each subgoal should have clear success criteria
- **Dependency Clarity**: Relationships between subgoals should be explicit

**Subgoal Hierarchy Rules**:
- **Single Parent**: Each subgoal should support only one parent goal
- **Clear Contribution**: Each subgoal must advance parent goal measurably
- **Validation Path**: Each subgoal must have defined acceptance criteria
- **Progress Visibility**: Each subgoal must have measurable progress indicators

### Subgoal Relationship Types
<!-- AI GUIDANCE: Define how subgoals relate to each other and parent goals. -->

**Sequential Subgoals** (Must be completed in order):
- **Definition**: Subgoal A must complete before Subgoal B can start
- **Validation**: Clear deliverable dependency between subgoals
- **Management**: Track progress through sequence, focus on current subgoal
- **Risk**: Delays in early subgoals cascade to later ones

**Parallel Subgoals** (Can be completed simultaneously):
- **Definition**: Multiple subgoals can proceed independently
- **Validation**: No blocking dependencies between subgoals
- **Management**: Monitor multiple progress streams, allocate resources across subgoals
- **Risk**: Resource conflicts between parallel subgoals

**Conditional Subgoals** (Completion depends on intermediate results):
- **Definition**: Subgoal B only starts if Subgoal A meets specific criteria
- **Validation**: Clear decision points based on measurable outcomes
- **Management**: Regular checkpoints to decide whether to proceed
- **Risk**: May need to change direction based on intermediate results

## üìà Dependency Management Process

### Dependency Monitoring Framework
<!-- AI GUIDANCE: How to track and manage goal dependencies over time. -->

**Regular Dependency Reviews**:
- **Weekly Check**: Review active dependencies for status changes
- **Milestone Reviews**: Assess dependency impact at subgoal completions
- **Monthly Reviews**: Evaluate overall dependency health and risks
- **Quarterly Reviews**: Reassess dependency validity and necessity

**Dependency Health Indicators**:
- **On Track**: Prerequisite goals progressing as planned
- **At Risk**: Dependencies may not be met on schedule
- **Blocked**: Dependencies cannot be satisfied
- **Changed**: Dependency requirements have evolved

### Dependency Change Management
<!-- AI GUIDANCE: How to handle changes in goal dependencies. -->

**Dependency Addition Process**:
- **Identification**: New dependency discovered or requirement emerges
- **Validation**: Confirm dependency is necessary and feasible
- **Impact Assessment**: Evaluate effect on dependent goals
- **Communication**: Notify all affected goal stakeholders

**Dependency Removal Process**:
- **Obsoletion**: Dependency no longer needed due to goal changes
- **Alternative Found**: Better approach eliminates original dependency
- **Constraint Relaxation**: Original requirement no longer applies
- **Communication**: Notify stakeholders of dependency removal

**Dependency Modification Process**:
- **Scope Change**: Dependency requirements have evolved
- **Timeline Adjustment**: Dependency timing needs to change
- **Alternative Options**: Different way to satisfy dependency
- **Communication**: Update all stakeholders on modifications

## üîç Dependency Validation and Quality Assurance

### Automated Dependency Checking
<!-- AI GUIDANCE: Automated validation of dependency structures and relationships. -->

**Structural Validation**:
- **Circular Dependency Detection**: Identify goals that depend on each other
- **Orphaned Goal Identification**: Find goals with no dependencies or dependents
- **Missing Link Detection**: Identify unclear or incomplete dependency chains
- **Timeline Consistency**: Ensure dependency timelines are realistic

**Semantic Validation**:
- **Requirement Clarity**: Ensure dependency requirements are specific
- **Feasibility Assessment**: Validate that prerequisite goals can realistically be achieved
- **Impact Justification**: Confirm that dependencies are necessary
- **Alternative Consideration**: Check if stated dependencies are truly required

### Dependency Quality Metrics
