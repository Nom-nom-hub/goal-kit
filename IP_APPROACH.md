- **Credibility**: Open sharing builds trust and demonstrates confidence in the work

## Attribution-Based Recognition

### Recommended Attribution
When using the Goal-Driven Development methodology, we appreciate attribution as follows:

- Network effects from community adoption
- Opportunities for consulting and training
- Enhanced reputation in the development community

## Conclusion

This open approach with attribution provides the best balance between encouraging widespread adoption of the Goal-Driven Development methodology while appropriately recognizing the original research and development investment. The MIT License provides legal clarity while the attribution mechanism acknowledges the original work.
