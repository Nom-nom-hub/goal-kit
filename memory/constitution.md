# [PROJECT_NAME] Development Constitution
<!-- Example: Goal Constitution, ProjectName Constitution, etc. -->

## Core Principles

### [PRINCIPLE_1_NAME]
<!-- Example: I. Goal-First -->
[PRINCIPLE_1_DESCRIPTION]
<!-- Example: Every development effort starts with clear goals; Goals must define measurable outcomes before considering implementation; Clear success criteria required for all development efforts -->

### [PRINCIPLE_2_NAME]
<!-- Example: II. Multiple Strategies -->
[PRINCIPLE_2_DESCRIPTION]
<!-- Example: Every goal explores multiple implementation strategies; Approach comparison and evaluation required; No single "correct" implementation path -->

### [PRINCIPLE_3_NAME]
<!-- Example: III. Measurable Milestones -->
[PRINCIPLE_3_DESCRIPTION]
<!-- Example: All progress tracked through measurable milestones; Milestones validate assumptions and learning; Regular measurement and adaptation cycle -->

### [PRINCIPLE_4_NAME]
<!-- Example: IV. Adaptive Execution -->
[PRINCIPLE_4_DESCRIPTION]
<!-- Example: Execution with flexibility to adapt based on learning; Evidence-based strategy adjustments; Continuous learning and improvement -->

### [PRINCIPLE_5_NAME]
<!-- Example: V. Outcome Focus -->
[PRINCIPLE_5_DESCRIPTION]
<!-- Example: Focus on user and business outcomes over feature implementation; Success measured by goal achievement, not activity completion -->

## [SECTION_2_NAME]
<!-- Example: Additional Constraints, Success metrics, Measurement approaches, etc. -->

[SECTION_2_CONTENT]
<!-- Example: Specific success metrics requirements, measurement tools, milestone validation processes -->

## [SECTION_3_NAME]
<!-- Example: Goal Development Workflow, Review Process, Adaptation Process, etc. -->

[SECTION_3_CONTENT]
<!-- Example: Goal review requirements, milestone validation, adaptation approval process -->

## Governance
<!-- Example: Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require goal alignment, approval, adaptation plan -->

[GOVERNANCE_RULES]
<!-- Example: All development must verify compliance with goals; Use [GUIDANCE_FILE] for runtime development guidance -->
